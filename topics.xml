Dr. Sharp e Takes Side of
Player at Intercollegiate
Meeting.
LEAVE OUT ROUGHNESS
Too Many Tecnnicsfities It Claim of
Coaches and Players New
Role Affects Centers.
New York, Nov. 29. Exception to the
trend of collegiate Icglsla ion was voiced
In no uncertain terms at the annual inter
pretation .neetlng of the Intercollegiate
basket-ball rules committee at the Hotel
Astor yesterday afternoon Dr. A. II.
Sharpe, coach of the Cornell football,
basket-ball, and baseball teams, took the
side cf the plajer and coach against the
rules committee, which, he said, was con
cerning itself more with ruling on tech
nicalities than on the practical issues of
the game.
The discussion arose when Dr. Joseph
E. Ray croft chairman of the rules com
mittee, and the presiding officer, called
for the consideration of Rule 11, which Is
designed to penalize blocking. The rule
had been amended over summer so that it
read: "A player is entitled to take any
position on the court but if in taking a
position he faces an opponent or makes
bodily contact with an opponent so as to
interfere with the latter's progress he
Is blocking."
Dr. Raycrott said that the change had
been made In the rule 'as part of the
general plan of the rulemakers to elim
inate all unnecessary roughness and com
pel the plajers to "play the ball and not
the man." By this rule, said Dr. Ray
croft all Illegal Interference with a play
er by his opponent resulting from the
close guarding of pla, would be deemed
a foul and penalized as such.
Dr. Sharpe carried his point because.
when the discussion had been concluded
and a vote taken on the Interpretation of
the rule Dr. It ay croft and Ralph Mor
gan, of the University of Pennsylvania,
secretary of the committee, agreed to
permit an editorial correction which sub
stituted an "and" for the "or" in the
rule in question, making it mean that
only by direct bodily contact can a player
block his opponent
The most important changes In the rules
forthe coming year have to do with the
"Jump" ball and the ball when It goes
out of bounds. In order to eliminate the
fouling that so frequently happened under
the old Jump rule, the players Jumping
for the ball now, either In the center or
on any part of the floor will have to
Jump with one hands behind the back.
The meeting ruled that b behind the
back was meant behind any part V the
back below the shoulder, with the hand
touchihg the back, rather than the strict
working of the section, which compelled
the player to have on hand behind the
back at the waistline.
The other rule regarding the Jump ball
was aimed to do away with a great many
of the "Jumps" along the sideline after
the ball has been out of bounds by giv
ing it to the opponent of the man last
touched by It The rules relating to
dribbling were also discussed, but no rul
ing was made.</text>

ANEW record in the history of
western athletics was made yes
terday by runners in the Los An
geles to Venice Marathon race, given
under the auspices of the Los Angeles
Athletic club.
The race is distinctly the classic
athletic event of the coast. Eleven of
the twenty-three racers participating
lowered the former record, and George
B. Miller, winner of yesterday's con
test, covered the distance of 15% miles
in 1 hour and 41 seconds, a record which
future runners will find it difficult to
lower.
Miller's success was a surprise to all,
as no one had selected him as a likely
winner, and his name did not appear
among those who had been picked by
enthusiasts as probable winners. In
fact, he had not expected to win, and
had entered the race only to see what
he could do.
Finishing strong at the tape, Miller
did not seem to be much tired. Clad
in his running clothes, he conversed
with admiring spectators, while others
who had participated were being helped
tj dressing rooms where medical as
sistance was rendered.
Miller is a carpenter and lives at 749
San Julien street, Los Angeles. He is
26 years old and married. It is by mere
chance he entered the race. He was
urged by W. Burness, his trainer an-i
a man of many years' experience in
racing circles, to compete. Burness
had observed the young man had shown
great endurance when they went into
the country for tramps over the hills,
and he urged him to enter the race.
Miller is not a runner, never had taken
part in a race and had been trained
for a month only. This training he
did after working- hours, for he had
been engaged regularly at his trade
up to the time of the race. He n^ver
had run more than ten miles at one
time previous to the contest of yester
day.
Miller did not want to enter the race
because he had no running shoes and
because he thought he had no chance
to win; but his trainer persisted and
so he listed his name, saying he would
"just try it and see if he could stay
with the runners for a few miles."
Surpasses Expectations
Many persons thought the former
record of 2:01:30, made by Edward
Dietrich in September, would be low
ered ten minutes in yesterday's con
test. A few even ventured to assert
they thought it would be lowered fif
teen minutes. No one was so opti
mistic 2« to suggest that twenty min
utes would be taken from the estab
lished record. Miller lowered the rec
or 1 twenty minutes and thirty seconds
surpassing the most liberal predic
tions.
Miller averaged 6 minutes and 45
seconds a mile for the entire distance
The first four runners averaged better
than 7 minutes a mile. Considering the
condition of the course and the dis
tance, this is a remarkable record. Five
minutes is not considered slow time for
a mile run on a cinder path, where
contestants use spiked running shoes.

By this comparison it readily can be
seen the pace set by the leaders was a
difficult one to maintain.
Practically every man of the twen
ty-three who started, exterted his ut
most to the end. There were few mis
l ps and all but three of the con
testants covered the entire course to
V-nice. Some of the veteran runners
who thought they were certain to win
are somewhat disgruntled at having a
new man, without any records to his
credit, take away the laurels.
From beginning to end the race was
as manly an exhibition of sportsman
ship as ever has been witnessed on
this coast. There is but little doubt
that the Marathon race will become an
annual event and that runners from
every part of the United States will
come to take part in it. It will grow
in importance as an athletic contest
until it shall attract national and
worldwide attention and be looked for
ward to as an event of first importance
in long distance road racing.
Thousands of persons lined the
course of the race, both inside and
outside the city limits, to see the run
ners pass by. Every man was num
bered so he could be picked out by
those having one of the lists published
in the daily newspapers. A small
army of wheelmen followed the racers
for the entire distance, shouting words
of encouragement to favorites. Dozens
of automobiles, carrying friends of the
runners and officials of the course,
followed the contestants.
Thousands View Contest
The start was made at the Los An
geles Athletic club, at 534 South Spring
street, promptly at 9:35 o'clock, a. m.,
when R. A. Rowan, president of the
club, flred the starting gun. Hundreds
of persons blocked Spring street to see
the start, and some of the runners were
cheered by organized bands of their
friends. So numerous was the crowd
the runnei-s had difficulty in getting a
start, and there was much delay before
the contestants finally ran into the

open in front of the Hotel Hayward
and settled into their paces.
In less than five minutes the partici
pants had spread out for a distance
of several hundred yards. The dis
tance apart became greater as the
race progressed, and at the finish the
men were scattered widely along the
course.
Edward Dietrich, champion of the
last race and first winner of The Her
ald cup, began to breathe heavily a.t
Eleventh street, much to the conster
nation of the many persons who had
looked on him as a sure winner. If
there was any general favorite in the
race. Dietrich was that man, largely be
cause of his previous record. It was a
surprise to everyone to see him giv
ingl out at the first.
For some weeks the former cham
pion has been suffering with a severe
cold. He found at the beginning of
the race he could not breathe through
his nostrils, and his efforts to get
sufficient air through his mouth soon
told on him. He ian close to Isaacs
until Adams street was reached. It
was pure grit which carried him on
from that point. He gave up before
reaching Hoover street, his follower
draging him from the street and call
ing for medicnl assistance.
From Hoover to Western the con
testants were scattered over the entire
distance. Iri Schrag, bearing number
15, reached Western avenue in the lead,
and kept the first place until within
five miles of Venice. William Stanley,
number 10, the San Francisco walker,
held second place at Western avenue.
He kept close to the heels of Scrag, and
the two held the lead until they had
passed the Palms. Here Schrag was
forced to drop behind, and Stanley took
the lead, laughing and jesting with the
followers.
George W. Isaacs, the Los Angeles
Athlotic club runner and athlete, held
fourth place throughout the race and
finished fourth, Miller sprinting ahead
of him in the last few miles. Isaacs
ran a stubbornly fought, consistent race
AT THE STARTING LlNE—Finley

from start to finish. He did not give
any heed to the followers and specta
tors, but gave his entire attention to
the race. He knew his pace and held
it throughout the contest. He made an
excellent showing against the more
experienced runners, who tried in vain
to distance him.
At the new roadhouse Isaacs passed
White, who had been holding third
place up to that time. He held his new
position until he passed the Palms. Be
tween the Palms and Fredericks Miller
forged ahead of him and Schrag
dropped behind him rapidly to the rear.
M. L. White set the pace for Isaacs
from Hoover street to a point beyond
the six-mile post, when Isaacs took the
lead away from him. White was fol
lowing him closely at Fredericks and
forged ahead in the final grueling
sprint through Venice.
Charles Boscha held fifth place dur
ing the first part of the race. Then his
weak left foot began to trouble him
and he was passed by White, Miller and
Starr at the eleven-mile point. At
Fredericks there were five men ahead
of him. It was by hard exertions that
he made his rebellious foot do duty un
til he crossed the finish line at Venice.
Boscha was in splendid condition, ex
cept for his foot, and he seemed a likely
winner. His race was consistent and
showed headwork as well as physical
ability.
Oliver Starr is another contestant
who ran with his head as well as his
feet. At Western avenue Starr held
eighth place and kept to his pace. Then
he gradually reached sixth place and
held it until he arrived at Fredericks,
when he advanced again to fifth place.
During the final sprint he was unable
to make any gain on his speedy oppo
nents. Starr was followed by an or
ganized bunch of supporters, each wear
ing a large paper star. The men fol
lowed on wheels and cheered on their
favorite, who made an excellent
showing.
Paul Reinwald, the veteran hill
climber, did not make the showing ex-

pected of him. He lost his follower
early in the race and had to rely on
other men for water and attention. A
slight illness on the day before the race
probably contributed to his failure.
V. Newman, the T. M. C. A. runner,
made an excellent showing, although
in no condition for the race. He
weighed 175 pounds and was nearly 15
pounds overweight. Everyone who saw
him predicted he would not reach the
city limits. But he stayed in the race
until within sight of Venice, when his
feet could not withstand the pounding
any longer and he had to stop with
only a mile to the finish line.

Finishing amid a i. iult of applause that

James Clark, of the Xa\! r Athletic Associa
tion won the Brooklyn -Soa Gate Marathon run
of 26 miles and 385 yards yesterday afternoon, In

Athletic dub, finished BSCOnd; Harry Jensen,
of the Pastime Athletic Club, third, and Patrick
Grant of the Trinity Athletic Club, fourth.
Aside from the actual race Itself the crowd
which saw the contest will go down Into history
as one of the most remarkable ever gathered
'together for an athletic event of modern times.
To begin with, fully sis thousand persons
crowded the galleries and every point of van
tape within the spacious armory* while without
it was a rase of struggling humanity as far as
the eve could reach.
One hundred and sixty-six runners faced the
starter which broke all records in point of
number at least in this part of the country.
r thousands upon thousand, lined the course.

limbs'of trees strained to the breaking
nolnt with the weight of the precocious small
boy and a small idea of the demonstration may
be gathered. It was estimated that fully half a
million persons witnessed the race.
At certain points along the route the throngs
would close in so that, despite all efforts of the
police and an army of officials, the principals
barely found space to move. As the favorites
struggled on, accompanied by handlers on
wheels, the former at times found it difficulty
hear a' word of advice, always due to the same
reason— the indescribable discord of an excited
crowd.
That the race is not always to the swift found
another Illustration in the case of James J. Lee,
the Boston runner, who, after leading for seven
teen miles, collapsed, and had to be conveyed to
the armory in an automobile. As the contest
drew to a close it was no uncommon sight to see
tallow faced and leg weary men suddenly reel

History Marathon Running
Thirteen years ago tho first of the
modern Olympiads was held In Athens
Greece The first three men to finish In
the Marathon were Greeks Louis tho
winner was greeted h a shout that
roechoed for miles around tho sta
dium Thousands of foreigners who
wore represented at that International
meet acclaimed Louis a hero It seem
ed proper that a Greek should win
that classic event the Marathon run
And when two other Greeks followed
Louis across tho line In tho stadium It
seemed to bo definitely bottled that In
Greece the greatest distance runners In
the world were bred
It was tho revival ot the Olympic
games at Athens In 1806 that created
jthe recrudescence of Interest In long
distance running as a competitive
I sport Truo tho English revived tho
most ancient and most simple of ath
letic sports about seventy years ago
Prizes were offered In competitions all
over the country and from that time
until tho present England has pro
duced moro good runners than any
other country Tho Englishmen go In
moro for distance running than for
fast work as can bo easily seen from
closo scrutiny qf all tho records for
distance from ono mile up to twenty
After the 1S9G event In Athens tho
world evinced an Interest In Marathon
running Many countries participating
In tho Olympiad took up this branch of
sport and In these countries a new
generation of runners was born Prior
to this tlmo no ono In tho United
Statni offered prizes for men doing the
Marathon distance of 20 miles 355
yards Now tho Marathon Is tho most

Hayes, a compara
tively lesser light In
athletic circle* ir
New York, carried
the Stars and
Stripes to victory
by winning the
Marathon in the re
newal of the an
cient Olympic
games In the Lon
don stadium in
1908, he not only
achieved everlast
ing glory for him
self, but caused a
renewal of interest
in lons distance
running the like of
which America has
never known.
Since the triumph
of Hayes nearly
every city in this
country has had
Marathon races.
While it was gen
erally conceded that
the team from the
F. J. Haskln
United States would score an over
whelming victor. In th matter of
points at the Olympiad, there was little
deep rooted confidence in the ability
of the Americans to carry off premier
honors in the most coveted race on the
program. For years field and track
sports of all sorts had been enjoying
a healthful development in this country,
but the improvement in the class or
long distance runners had been so
gradual that it was hardly considered
likely that any American would bo able
to successfully match strides with the
stars representing the nations that had
for cent ries made an especial effort
to foster long distance running.
In the hope of at least making a
creditable showing in the Marathon,
several Americans went to the murk.
The result Is history—Dorando failing
in sight of the goal, while Hayes sped
to victory. It was not until the eighties
that American trac* athletes pitted
themselves against the English, Myers
and Merrill In 1881 being pioneers in
the movement that had its culmination
in Hayes' achievement.
While one of the oldest events on the
athletic card, the Marathon race was
almost forgotten until the revival of
the ancient games In an International
athletic contest in Athens in 1896. These
contests were held in the restored sta
dium that had existed before 330 B. C,
toward whose first erection patriotic
citizens had contributed everything
from the gold of one to the thousand
yoke of oxen that another gave, and
whose seats were covered with marble
si bs by Herodius as a gift to the Pan
athenaic festival. Time and war and
forgetfulness had burled the stadium,
but in 1863 Tit was partially excavated,
and before these international contests
it had been restored to Its original de
sign, the underground chambers for the
athletes being the same as when first
used 2000 years before.
There the first athletic Marathon
race was run in memory of that his
toric day 2276 years before, when one
Phllippides, an Athenian soldier, ran
from the plains of Marathon to the
palace In Athens to tell the kins of
the victory of Miltiades and his Atheni
an and Platean freemen over the mer
cenaries of Dar'.us. The runner dropped
dead at the feet of his ruler, so history
and tradition assert. The city accord
ed him every civil and military honor,
his body lying in state In the capitol
for three days. Among the most an
cient pieces of sculpture is that of the
dying Marathon runner.
Marathon lies on the northeast const
of Attica. There the worshp of Apollo
had its first homo, and the district
'boasts that Hercules was first wor
shiped there. On the battlefield is a
mound, or soroa. where the 192 Athenian
dead were hurled nfter the battle. It
was from this historic place that the
course of a novel race was laid out in
1896. a course that followed as near
as history coul*. show the path taken
by Phlllppides, and measuring twenty
six miles and 385 yards. On the day
of the new Marathon the king of the
Greeks was to receive the runner as
did his predecessor, though this time
SO 000 people waited, knowing, 'for the
coming of many runners. Tl.~ fact that
the runner was Splros Louces, son of a
peasant of Attica, brought forth the
greatest applause of the whole contest,
and enthusiastic chroniclers aver that
the great shout rolled" off against Mount
Pentelllcus on the one side and Mount
Hymettus on another as did the joy
ous acclamations of tha people of
twenty-two centuries before.
Marathon races had little hold on
popularity after this until the London
event last year, though it was hoped
at the time of the Buffalo exposition
that the stadium erected there might
remain permanently and the Marathon
run then under such climatic difficul
ties would become a big event In future
athletics. Hayes 1 winning acted as an
inspiration to the athletes of America,
and clubmen, schoolboys and college
students Immediately took to distance
running, which, even now, is complete
ly overehadowlng in publl favor track
contests at shorter distances.
In this country the colleges exercise
such a decided influence over athletics
that the clubmen copy the methods and
ingly saying they were only necessary
evils, an intelligent looking girl sud
denly stopped, and putting out her
hand majestically toward the man, said.
impressively:
"I have never had much faith in an
incubator, but now I am a firm believer
in them; a man never could talk like
that that ever had a mother." That
man instantly sneaked away.

ANSWERS ATTACK MADE
AGAINST SPIRITUALISM
LOS ANGELES, May 6.—[Editor
Herald]: If It be permissible to butt
Into another man's argument I beg
leave to differ with the argument
brought against spiritualism by Mr.
Spradlng. For a considerable time ha
"has appeared before the public as a
demolisher of popular Idols. Orthodox
Christianity, Christian Science, Marx
lan Socialism and Spiritualism have
been felled to the ground by his an
archistic fist, and by this time he must
have more scalps on his belt than any
other Liberal club member. No doubt
but what Mr. Sprading is sniffing
around for new game elsewhere. But
some of us won't give;up yet.
His argument against Spiritualism
is that;there is fraud: associated with
it that j the phenomena l of mediums
can be duplicated, V and that certain
scientific men are against it. Well, if
systems followed by the students, anj
the mot successful field and track
teams representing clubs depend large
ly upon former college men for their
real strength.
Johnny Hayes has written many ar
ticles on how to excel in the sport.
pointing out especially that the
important quality in a runner is dog^i il
persistence In training. Many of thn
greatest runners the world has ever
known first took up the sport for exer
cise alone, and it was on these pleasure
runs that they discovered that they
could attain a spe#d grreat enough to
enter races. In nearly every city
are at present clubs thatwere organ
ized to encourage Maraffion running.
Thousands" of men and boys who befor.j
last year never donned a running shoa
|are now undergoing especial courses in
developing wind and limb in the hope
of not only Improving their health but
becoming good athletes.

The usual mode of training is to jog
a couple of miles three times a week
on a pood road until the athlete or
his trainer feels that he Is sufficiently
developed to take longer distances,
when he commences to go ten or fif
teen miles without stopping. So numer
ous are the races at present that thera
is little need of a runner extending
himself to the limit. Few of the b«st
Marathon stars ever go the full dis
tance except in the races, although
they usually make it a point to run
twenty-five miles at least two or three
times before getting into actual com
petition.
In ihe Iden days, when a long dis
tance runner started his training he
usually denied himself every luxury
in order to work off surplus flesh, and,
as he thought, get in the very best con
dition. But all this has been changed
by the modern school of training, and
the almost universal rule at present is
to allow a man almost anything In
I the way of oating that does not disa
gree with him. It is Tie opinion
of most of the foremost trainers that
a man in training should abstain en
tirely from alcoholic liquors and to
bacco.

Perhaps the oldest of the annual
Marathons in this country Is the one
that has been conducted for the past
eleven years under the auspices of the
Boston Athletic association. It Is con
ceded the title of "American Marathon"
and is viewed each year by thousands
who line the course from beginlng to
end. The craze has also extended to
the navy, where several races have
been run aroand the decks of Uncle
Sam's men-of-war.
Since the London meet several of the
competitors in that race have met in
match contests, and ihe crowds that
have attended these events show beyond
a doubt that interest in the sport is in
no manner restricted to those who are
able to actually participate. Of these
post-Marathons the one that attract
ed the widest interest was the $10,000
Derby which was held in the polo
grounds, New York, last month, which
attracted about 30,000 spectators. In
this the first prize went to Henri St.
Yves, a Frenchman, who was supposed
to be completely outclassed by the for
midable field that included such men
as Hayes of America, Dorando the
Italian and Longboat the Indian. From
the outset St. Yves set a terrific pace
and literally ran his opponents off their
feet, winning by a liberal margin.
From a financial point of view this
race was one of the most successful
field and track affairs ever held in this
country.
One of the peculiar features of the
Marathon running is that the cleverest
men In the sport do not seem to suffer
from overparticlpatlon, a tendency that
must be closely guarded against In
other athletic activities. Dorando has
been in this country since early last
fall, and In that time he has on differ
ent occasions competed against the
best available talent in cities In all sec
tions. Despite the strain he has given
little indication of going "stale," but
on the other hand seeing to improve in
each successive performance. Hayes,
too, has given many exhibitions, and
has run several match races with first
class men, including Longboat the In
dian, who was one of the most promi
nent participants in the stadium tour
ney.
While Hayes has accumulated consid
erable money as the result of his vic
tory in London, it is said on good au
thority that Dorando has made more
than $20,000 since he reached these
shores several months ago—quits a
harvest for a. former pastr" taker in
a small town in the northern part of
Italy.
T.jre is a diversity of opinion among
medical authorities as to the probable
effect of running Marathon races. The
unanimity of opinion is that the sport
among undeveloped schoolboys or other
youngsters should be controlled so as
not to allow the untrained to run in
such a way as to make it too strenu
ous and result in permanent injury.
For centuries walking and running in
the open air have been considered
healthful, but when the distance has
become too long and the strain too
severe it has proved dangerous, as has
been shown by heart failure and even
death among tho runners. Among
trainers and even physicians who have
had opportunities to observe the con
dition of young boys the feeling is that
long races of distance exceeding a
mile should be avoided.
Rut for the thoroughly conditioned
athlete Marathons are not considered
harmful, and the present popularity of
the sport not only promises to become
permanent but should result In the de-^
velopment of long distance runners who
will be able to outclass the runners of
other countries. Among trainers and
other close followers of amateur and
even professional running there is a
feeling that the Marathon has come to
stay.</text>

	<text>JOHNNY HAYES, tha Marathon winner, arrived In
Newark yesterday. The story of how this sapling
of American youth outgamed, outlasted and outran
the pick of athletes of the civilized world In that memo
rable race from the royal gates of Windsor Castle to
tha stadium at ShoppardB Bush, a distance of 20 miles,
885 yards, at tho Olympic games In England last July;
how he carried the Stars and Stripes to victory, beating
out Dorando, the great Italian runner, at the very
threshold of the finish mark, and how Queen Alexandra
herself oestowed upon him the Marathon trophy, has
been blazed before tho public many a time, but, coming
from hls own lips, the following narrative does not coma
amiss.
One would believe that a followor of athletics who
has not heard of Hayes and hls victory must be a resi
dent of Um South Bole, but Johnny, while chatting away at THE STAR office
yesterday, rattled oft a yarn of meeting a chap at Providence last week who
didnt know whether the Marathon was a foot-race or one of these new
fangled aeroplanes. "I wonder If that fellow knows that the Civil War Is
over, and that John L. Sullivan has boon beaten for the heavyweight cham
pionship!” Jokingly remarked Hayes. "If it had happened In Philadelphia
there hilght have been an excuse for It.**
As a mater of fact, Johnny Hayes, since hls victory in England, has be
come almost as prominent as tho President of the United States. Big Bill
Taft, the presidential candidate of tho Republican party, received a great re
ception yesterday at Blaneys Theatre, but when the Marathon winner was
carried upon the stage at Proctors In a scene which represented the finish of
tha race, the applause must have been heard at Union Hill.
And right well ho deserved it. Think of a boy, weighing less than 130
pounds, running more than 2
htU and down, and then to beat out fifty-nine other competitors, the best that
nations could offer. What a strain, what nerve, what a triumph! The faded
shield of red, white and blue In the running shirt worn by the American,
which Is on exhibition In THE STAR window, Is mute testimony of the
gruelling ordeal through which the game little runner had passed.
Hayess Barly Achievements.
Title peer of athletes, a marvel for a youth of hls Inches, was born In
New York 22 years ago. He was not a boy of great physical power, and
didnt even train consistently, according to hls own story, for hls early
raoea But he was fond of athletics, and even In hls boyhood days could
heal "every kid In tho block” at the running game.
Hayes won hls novice race In 1904, when he finished first In the Pastime
id^ 0.1 cross-country run at a distance of six miles.
After he had won that race, P. J. Murray, a familiar figure in tho ath
letic world, slapped the youngster on the back and told him that he would
be great runnor some day.
T took It for so much *hot air* at the time,” said Hayes, "but I deter
knlaod to stick to the game, If only for the sport of It.”
On Thanksgiving Day, 1904, the boy who was later destined to win the
neatest Marathon race in modern history competed In the junior national
icroee-country championship race. He finished third In a field of 88. A year
jjader he finished fourth In the Metropolitan junior championship race.
In 1909 Hayes ran fifth In the Boston Marathon, in which a hundred ath
gcompeted. Last year the little Now Yorker, having Jujst turned hls 21st
carried off third honors In another Marathon at Boston. That was the
Tom Longboat, tho Indian runner, beat tho record for the course by five
tea Hayes trained with the idea of running close to the record, and
|finished only 48 seconds behind, but no runner could keep astride with the
iXndian that day.
i At that, Hayes was delayed two m Inutes by a freight train which crept
across tho course. Longboat had pas sed tho crossing before the freight had
blocked the wan

	<text>CRACK RUNNERS TO SETTLE
WORLD’S MARATHON TITLE,
New York, April IS.—Tlio world’s
Marathon championship will be decided
on the Polo grounds Saturday after
noon, May X, when the best men now
running will compete over the regular
Marathon distance of 26 miles 385 yards.
For some time the Marathon contests
have been confined to a few selected
runners, but the real claimants of the
title have not been seen in competi
tion. Of the men who have appeared
before the American public Henri St.
Yves, the speedy little Frenchman, is
the only one with an unbeaten record
on this side of the water, and the Polo
grounds race will definitely establish a
champion'.
The introduction of new blood will
serve to stimulate the public interest in
long distance running, while the addi
tion of several of the better known
men on this side will bring about the
long-sought opportunity of determining
who is the best Marathon runner in
the world.
So as to make the race a real cham
pionship affair invitations have been
sent out to Henri St. Yves, Dorando
Pietri, John J. Hayes, John Svanborg,
Edouard Cibot, Louis Orphee, Jerry
Simpson, Tom Longboat and Pat
White. This will bring together an ag
gregation of long distance talent never
before entered in an event.</text>

	<text>Good Runners are Entered for Mara
'thon Race on Sept. 3.
Interest in the coming Marathon race
to be held at the Central Maine park
Friday, Sept. 3, is nt present very keen
and the people are assured of witness
ing a race such as is seen in other parts
of thq country. Some of the best run
ners have signified their intention of
coming.
Henri Renaud of Nashua, N. H
broke' into prominence as a. Marathon
runner by winning the Boston Mara
thon, held under the auspices of the
Boston Athletic Association on April
19 of this year. Bast Saturday he won
a 15-piile race from one of the best
Marathon runners in the country.
John Cullen of Narragansett Bier, R.
1., is a seasoned Marathon runner, and
bound to give a good account of him
self.
William Rozette of the Pastime Ath
letic Club of New York, although a
/oung boy, has been running for four
>r five years, and is the winner of the
Rye Beach Marathon held in Boston
ast fall.
James W. O’Mara. formerly of the
r,ambridgeport gymnasium, and now of
Yonkers, N. Y., is another well known
Marathon runner. His most notable
win was the Brockton Marathon held
last October.
Edwin Ryder of Jamacia Plain, is
another young man well known in
Marathon circles and at 20 miles is con
sidered unbeatable.
William Weisman of the South Bos

CHAMPION HAYES
IN EXHIBITION RUN
BEFORE MARATHON
Eleventh Hour Objection of A. A. 1). Bars
Him from the STAR’S Endurance Test.
Crowd Sees Runner on Broad
Street Just Before Noon.
JOHN J. HAYES, winner of Ihe Marathon race at the Olympic games In
London, gave an exhibition sprint In Broad street this morning Just
a few minutes before the great Marathon race of TIIE EVENING STAR.
This sudden and unexpected change In the advertised program was made
necessary by the eleventh-hour objeo tlon of the Amateur Athletic Union, un
der whose auspices the race Is being run, to having Hayes give an exhi
bition run at any time during the big race
Hayes had agreed to run with the 166 entrants a few miles at the start
of the Marathon, after he had fired the starting gun. He was also to Join
the racers near the finish and come In with them.
The A. A. U. wrote a letter late last
night to THE EVENING STAR for
bidding the running of Hayes during
the Marathon. This letter was not
received until this morning, and not
until then was the race management
aware of the objection to Hayes.
But the Marathon race must comply
strictly to the A. A. U. rules, otherwise
every one of the 166 men entered In It
would be disqualified.
Johnny Hayes left THE EVENING
STAR office shortly before 1 m today.
He was taken In an automobile to
Clinton avenue and Broad street. From
there he made an exh ibition sprint, In
his championship Marathon form, to
THE EVENING ST—', office. Broad
and Market streets.

Hayee fired the starting gun.
The letter making It Impossible for
Hayes to give his exhibition sprints
while the Marathon Is one, which made
It necessary for him to run before the
regular race, follows:
Marathon Editor,
Newark EVENING STAR.
794 Broad street, Newark, N. J.
Dear Sir—I have just seen a circular
advertising the Newark EVENING
STAR Marathon race, and I notice that
on same It states that Johnny Hayes,
winner of the Olympic Marathon race
In London, will act as starter and will
run exhibition relays at the start and
finish of the race.
Mr. Hayes can act as starter, but the
A. A. U. rules will not permit him to
run relays at the start or during the
race. If you wish him to give an exhi
bition after the race Is over he can do
so, as the race, as far as we are con
cerned, would be closed.
Kindly give this matter your prompt
attention so that there will be no mis
understanding. Yours truly,
II. OBERTUBBESINO.
Chairman Registration Committee.
James E. Sullivan, president of the
Amateur Athletic Union, arrived In
Newark early today to act as referee
of the contest. He declared that It
should prove to be the greatest race
ever run In this country.</text>

NEW YORK, May 16—For all
the shouting there has been about
the decadence of American long
distance running talent it remains
a fact that Uncle Sam's entries
have done as well, if not better
than those of any other nation in
the classic Olympic Marathon.
Finland’s two triumphs since
the war, by Kolehmainen in 1920
at Antwerp and Stenroos, the
cabinet maker, in 1924 at PariR,
are fresher in mind but over the
long stretch of Olympic rivalrv j
America has given a good account
of herself and promises to do so
again this summer at Amsterdam,
with Joie Ray and Clarence De
Mar leading the pack.
Finland and America are the
only nations to produce more
than one Marathon king. The
Yankee triumphs of Hicks at St.
Louis in 1904 and 19-year-old
Johnny Hayes at London in 1908
match the sterling victories of
the Finns in the last two Olym
piads.
On three other occasions in the
games of 1906, 1912 and 1924 the
United States finished no worse
than third. Three of the first
four in 1908 were Yankees. At
Stockholm four years later the
South Africans, McArthur and
Gitsham, finished onedwo hut
Gaston Strobino came in third
for America and ten of the first
18 to finish wore the rod, white
and bine shield on their jerseys.
DeMar was twelfth.

approached before or since by
any other country. Finland did
not have a single finisher in 1912
but landed four of the first ten
places in 1920.
This year there seems at least,
an even chance that the most
highly prized Olympic victory will
go to an American marathoner,
with the prospects now fuvorin t;
either DcMar, 40 years old and a
veteran of two previous Olympics
or Ray, the former mile king.
DeMar and Ray, as a result of
their performances in the first
official Olympic tryout, are the
outstanding contenders. DeMai.

seems to ripen and improve with
age. The wiry little Melrose run
ner has inexhaustible stamina, I
keen racing judgment and experi-j
ence in his favor. But his ambi-i
tlon to crown a brilliant career
with Olympic victory this time,
after finishing third in 1024, is
no greater than that of Ray.
Joie, too, has been denied the
satisfaction of Olympic victory in
two previous trips abroad. Where i
he failed as a middle distance j
runner ho is confident of succes:1 I
over th long grind. Ray’s won
derful sttlde, natural grit and con
fidence are In his favor.
The history of the Olympic!
Marathon, rich ns it is in color, I
could have 31 mire dramatic epi-1
sode than a triumph for the old
Kankakee Flier.
Tw no years ago .Toltnny Hayes
made Km elf a national idol by,
his Marathon victory, even!
though it was gained because of j
[he collapse of the Italian, Doran-j
do, who had led Johnny into the:
stadium by a substantial margin!
and who would have won had liis|
stamina been enough to carry 1
him over the remaining few him-1
ilred yards.
The tragedy in that race over
Dorando’s downfall had a comic!
relief in the protest of Hefferon,!
the South African, who finished j
second, that Hayes also was help
ed across the finish. Hefferon
was not inside the stadium when
Hayes finished and had no basis
for such a protest unless he fig
ured it was one way of joining
the general argument that the
Finish aroused.
Hefferon’s friends, in extenua
tion of his failure to win, explain
3d later that the distance wa3
too short for him and that he
was not at his best under about
10 miles.
No other Olympic event is so
universil in interest or repre
sentation as the Marathon. Twen
ty nations entered runners in the
1912 race. Thirty were repre
sented in 1924 when Finland.

	<text>One of the most notable features of the
scientific tendencies of the present day is
the extraordinary interest taken in the in
vestigation ofthosejeculiar physical and
psychical conditions now known collec
tively under the name of hypnotism
varying from lethargy catalepsy etc to
somnambulism Until quite recently
these investigations have been frowned
upon and taboed in scientific circles and
the fact that any man of scientific inclina
tions was known to feel an interest in
matters associated with mesmerism or
animal magnetism was sullicient to
make him an object of suspicion and in
jure his good standing among his fellow
scientists The result of these socalled
investigations instituted by the French
academy pronouncing in effect the whole
subject a humbug and delusion has lain
like an interdict upon further re
searches and the whole matter was left
over for the most parr to charlatans or
to persons hardly capable of forming
sound judgment or proceeding according
to the accurate methods demanded by
modern science Science however in
the remarkable progress made of late
23 advanced so far upon certain lines
vt It has been hardly possible to pro
od further in those directions without
leering upon the forbidden fied There
re the old signboards against trespass
is have bten taken down For
mesmerism that verbal scarecrow has
been substituted hypnotism which
word has had a wonderfully legitimizing
effect while animal magnetism that
once llouted idea has been proven to be
sn existing fact by methods as accurate
as those adopted by Faraday or
Edison to verily their observations
EFFORTS OK SCIENTISTS
Many of the most eminent scientists of
Europe are now devoting themselves
assiduously to these researches Periodi
cals making a specialty of the subject are
now published in France Germany and
England A catalogue of the recent
literature of hypnotism and related phe
nomena compiled by Max Dessoir was
printed in the number of the German
magazine called the Sphinx for February
of this year and this catalogue occupied
nine pages The list is limited to those
words written on the lines laid under the
methods of the modern school all books
being excluded whose authors hold to
mesmeric theories or who are even
professional magnetizers The catalogue
is therefore as strictly scientific as pos
sible and being classified with German
thoroughness under the different branches
of the subject such as hysterohypnot
ism suggestion fascination etc
it will prove a valuable assistance to the
udent
In this country the interest of scient
1s has not yet been aroused to an ex
mt comparable to that of European in
jstigators Old prejudices have not
5tirely lost their potency One of the
most eminent professors of s leading
university is said to have been subjected
to ridicule from his colleagues because of
a marked interest shown in the subject
and a Boston physician of high standing
within a few months confided to the
writer that he had made use of hypnotic
methods with gratifying success in the
case of a patient where ordinary reme
dies hd proved unavailing but he did
not venture to make the result public
since his fellowdoctors might be inclined
to condemn his action as irregular
A work embracing the whole subject
has lately appeared in Paris and as it is
to form a volume of the valuable Inter
national Scientific series published in
English French German and Italian it
can hardly fail to diffuse a correct popu
lar understanding of the results thus far
attained The book is called Le Mag
netism Animal Animal Magnetism
and its authors are Messrs Alfred Binet
and Charles Fere of the medical staff of
the Saltpetrier Hospital for Nervous Dis
orders in Paris It gives a history of the
patient researches conducted at that in
stitution by the medical staff under the
celebrated Professor Charcote during the
past nine years These experiments have
been prosecuted according to the most
exact scientific methods and with the
most extreme caution The endeavor
has been to obtain first of all the
most elementary psychic phenomenon
and to test every step in the
investigations by separate experiments
specially devised to prove the good faith
of the subject and the reality of his hal
lucination to eliminate the possibility of
unconscious suggestion to establish re
lations with similar phenomena of disease
or health in tne domain of physiology
and to note the modifications which can
be brought about by altering the condi
tions of the experiments The authors
possess the great scientific virtue of
never dogmatizing In the entire book
not a single law is laid down not a
single hypothesis is advanced which is
not reached by the most improved in
ductive processes A great service of
the book lies in its enunciation of new
and trustworthy methods for studying
the physiology of the brain in health and
disease while It brings into the realm of
physical experiment vexed questions ot
psychology heretofore given over to met
aphysical methods exclusively
THE HYPNOTIC SLEEP
is described as a different form of natu
ral sleep and all the causes which bring
on fatigue are capable of bringing on
hypnotism on suitable subjects Two
of the leading hypnotic states are lethar
gy and catalepsy the former being anala
gous to deep sleep and the latter to a
light slumber In lethargy the respirato
ry movements are slow and deep cat
alepsy slight shallow very slow and
separated by a long interval In lethargy
the application of a magnet over the re
gion of the stomach causes profound mod
ifications in the breathing and circulation
while there is eo such effect in catalepsy
This shows the connection of hypnotism
with magnetism and various other ex
periments with magnets have produced
some wonderful results Here it may be
added that Dr Geesmam a Vienna
scientist who has made a specialty of
hypnotic 8titdies has Invented and suc
cessfully applied an Instrument called a
hypnoscope consisting of an arrangement
of magnets for the purpose of ascertain
ing whether any persons is a good hyp
notic subject
The experiments demonstrate that
sensation In the hypnotic states varies
Detween the two opposite poles of
hypetcc3thesia and antesthesia in other
words the senses may be extraordinarily
excited as in somnambulism or as in
lethargy they may be extinct except
sometimes hearing In somnambulism
the field of vision and acutebess of sight
are about double hearing is made very
acute and smell is so intensely develop
ed that a subject can find by scent the
fragments of a card previously given to
him to feeJ and torn up and hidden The
memory of somnambulism is similarly
exalted When awakened the subject
does not as a rule remember anything
that occurred when he was entranced
but when again hypnotized his memory
includes all the facts of his sleep his life
when awake and his former sleeps
ltichet attests how somnambules recall
with a luxury of detail scenes in which
they have taken part and places they
have visited long ago M one of
his somiambules sings the air of the
second act of the opera LAfricaine when
she is asleep but cnnot remember a
note of it when awake
There is a theory that no experience
wlmtever of a person is lost to the mem
ory it is only the power to recall it that
is defective The authors of this work say
that while the exaltation of the memory
during somnambulism does not give ab
solute proof to the theory that nothing is
lost it proves at any rate that the mem
ory of preservation is much greater than
is generally imagined in comparison with I tauce of
ing recollection more
or less vivid per
sists for a lew seconds then becomes ef
faced This forgetfulness is even more
marked in the case of hypnosis On re
turning to natural consciousness the sub
ject cannot recompose o single one of the
scenes in which he has played his part as
a witness or actor The loss howeveri3
not complete for often a word or two is
sufficient to bring back a whole scene
though this word or two coming from
operator to subject partakes more or less
of the nature ot a suzgestion
SUGGESTION
Suggestion by which is meant the
production of thoughts and actions on the
part of the subject through some indica
tion or bint given by the operator is
found to be analagous to dreaming Say
the authors All suggestion consists
essentially in acting on a person by an
idea every effect suggested is the re
sultant of a phenomenon of ideation but
we must add that the idea is but an
outward sign taken alone it is only in
dicative of some physiological process
which Is alone capable of producing a
material effect Persons vary in their
susceptibility to suggestion For sug
gesiion to succeed the subject must have
naturally fallen or been artifically
thrown into the state of morbid re
ceptivity but it is difficult to deter
mine accurately the conditions of susges
tionability However we may mention
two The first is the mental inertia or
the subject the consciousness
is completely empty an idea is suggest
ed and reigns supreme over the slumber
ing consciousness The second
is psychic hyperexcitability the cause of
the aptitude for suggestion From the
standpoint of psychology the explanation
of the effects of suggestion is to be found
in the association of ideas Suggestion
in its positive aspect is nothing eise than
the throwing Into action of a mental as
sociation preexisting in the spirit
of the hypnotic For example we
say to a patient Look you have a
bird in your apron and no sooner arc
these simple words pronounced than she
sees the bird feels it with herfingersand
sometimes even hears it sing All these
ideas are associated in the mind by habit
and consequently they are called into
action Again in place of speech we
engage the attention of the patient and
when her gaze has become settled and
obediently follows all our movements we
imitate with the hand the motion of an
object which dies Soon the patient
cries Oh what a pretty bird How
has a simple gesture produced so singu
lar an effect Again by the association
of ideas But this case differs from the
preceding in being only an association of
resemblance</text>

	<text>Study of the Hypnotic State.
Dr. A. Dichas has mado n detailed study
of tho memory In tho hypnotic state, nnd
summarizes his main conclusions
as follows: (1) during tlio hypnotic
sleep tho subject remembers the experiences
of his wiking Ufo ns well rs of
previous hypnosis; (2) in hypnotism tlicro
is often an exalt tion of tho memory, and
at times n cliang in Its content, leading
to tho assumpti n of a foreign
(3) tho mo nory of what has been
going on during hypnosis is usually lost,
it can often bo ruvlvcd by n simplo suggestion,
and at times the memory of a
suggested hallucination may l!.,jor on.
and influenco thu waking condition; (4)
tho operator cau at his wjll havo any of
tho nets of the liypnotK state remembered
or forgotten by maMug this a part
of tho suggestion; (5) sitgjfcstion seems to
bo largely explicable 'as unconscious
memory.
Dr. Cybulski has studied tho power of
hypnotic subjects to hypnotlzo themselves.
IIo finds that such subjects
strongly Imagiuo for a mlnuto or less that
that tho operator commands them to go
to sleep, nnd tho desired result ensues.
Furthermore, If tlio subject, on going to
sleep, imagines himself controlled by a
certain person, then, even though another
sent him to sleep, he will bo subject to
tlio former, nnd not to tho operator.
These observations show the Importance
of tho subjectivo clement in tho process
of hypnotism, nnd Indicate tho method by
which tho subject unconsciously takes
suggestions and acts upon them. Dr.
Bcrkhan has applied hypnotism to the
amelioration of the hearing of tho deaf.
Ho tested tho hearing of nino deaf boys,
and, after hypnotizing them, spoko to
them and had varions.noises made before
them Tho hearing of four of them was
found to bo Improved, and tho improve

	<text>FOR the first time In legal history, a
court of law has taken cognizance of
hypnotism as a defense against a
criminal charge and has released a pris
oner on the ground that in performing the
criminal act the accused was only a ma
chine, animated by and helplessly obeying
the will of a master mind.
Thus in real life we have the exact sit
uation which .made Du Maurier's famous
novel, "Trilby," a classic of fiction.
Norma McLeod is the name of this pres
ent day incarnation of the novelist's fancy.
Scarcely twenty-one, trembling, shaken
down to the very depths of her soul by her
experiences but once again mistress of
that soul, her heart and her body she con
vinced a wise judge, skeptical lawyers and
medical experts of the truth of her story,
forcing them to accept what to them
seemed at first and to many still may
seem, the incredible.
And when she was finished Judge
Thomas C. Craln, of the Court of Special
Sessions, whose hair has grown white in
his service of justice, said to her:
"The court releases you on a suspended
sentence of five years because it believes
that you were not responsible for the act
you committed, but that you acted under
the control of a will stronger than your
own."
Harry Sanderson, a soldier of fortune,
"Who, Norma McLeod says, was the Sven
gali to her Trilby, is missing with the po
lice seeking him so that he may be put in
a place where the uncanny force of which
he seems to be a master may be exerted
against unimaginative, wholly practical
jailers.
But unlike DuMaurier's Svengali, San
derson does not seem to have had to de
pend upon the use of staring eyes, mystic
passes with the hands and all the other
tricks of the stage hypnotist. Svengali's
methods were described by Du Maurier
thus:
"But all at once with one wave of his
hand over her with one look of his eye
with a word Svengali could turn her into
the other Trilby, his Trilby and make her
do whatever he liked.
"He had but to say 'sleep and she sud
denly became an unconscious Trilby who
could produce just the sounds he wanted
and nothing else and think his thoughts
and wish his wishes and love him at his
bidding with a strange, unreal love just
his own love for himself turned inside
ut a renvers and reflected back on him
as from a mirror."
Miss McLeod says that her master was
always very gentle with her, but that what
he told her to do she had to do-, that she
possessed no will, no thought except his
when he chose to exert his power over her.
And that, like Trilby's, her heart, her body
and her soul were at his mercy.
The specific charges upon which Miss
McLeod was arrested was the forgery on
a check of the name of Louis Missi, the
landlord of the apartment house at 248
West Forty-eighth street, where Sander
son and the girl lived. Sanderson had a
fancied grievance against Missi; he thought
the latter was obstructing telephone mes
sages'' to him. The forged check was pun
ishment. To wreak this punishment he
used Miss McLeod Just as he would have
used a pen or a pencil. Under his will she
was nothing more than one of these instru
ments in the hand of the adventurer' and
no more to blame for what was written
than pen or pencil would have been. This,
in effect, was the opinion of the court that
freed her.
What kind of a girl is Miss McLeod that
all her consciousness, her will and consci
ence could be so thrust out of her, leaving
her body only a shell in which worked
another's will and consciousness? How
did she fall into the power of the master

	<text>PROFESSOR IS SHOT
BY HYPNOTIZED GIRL
By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press Correspondent)
Berlin. (By Mail).The danger
that amateur hypnotists will further
impair public morals i3 seen by the
Vienna ^feddcal weekly, in a discus
scion of the* recent attack on Prof.
Wagner-Juaregg, Vienna, by a hyp
notized girl.
Jauregg bad asserted that crime
could not be induced by hypnosis
whereupon an amateur hypnotist sug
gested to a seventeen-year old girl the
asrassination of the professor and
provided her with a pistol loaded
with paper bullets. She made the at
tack. The medical journal, however,
contends that Juaregg*s theory was
not entirely disproved since the hyp
notist induced the attack under false
premises and suggested to his sub
ject that the whole affair was harm
lessas it was. Hence it was not a
crime.
But, the paper contends that the
amateur hypnotists can perhaps
spread a suggestion among the public
for disruption of the whole process
of criminal justice. If sqch a process
were undertaken, then there would
be no need for "compulsory hypnosis"
as in the Jauregg case, in order to
establish a plea for light punishment,
since the public would not require
punishment. Incidentally, the paper
sayi there have been cases in the
past of "compulsory (or intentional)
drunkenness," undertaken as a basis
for a plea to escape justice
The Jauregg case has* aroused the
Interest of psychologists and hypnot
ists thruout central Europe. Since
the attack, the girl has been the sub
ject of experiments which revealed
the process to which she was sub
mitted in the course of the amateur's
efforts to disprove the expert's theory.</text>

	<text>The Mysteries of Hypnotism
and Transferenceof Thought
Tfje Former, Says Garrett P. Serviss, Noted
Scientific Writer, Is a Real Phenomenon That Has
Possibilities of Important Service to Mankind, But
It Must Be Handled Cautiously. Telepathy, in the
Shadow Land of Science, Still Has to Prove Its Case,
Although Investigators Report Apparently Well
Authenticated Manifestations of Its Existence.
By Garrett
Ii It a fact that one perion can
hypnotise another person, or Is It
Jut mere talk? Does science ap
prove of mental telepathy" O. A.
A.. Streator, III
HYPNOTISM Is an estab
lished fact, but the ex
planation of it is still more
or less obscure. It is recognized
by high authorities as a valuable
method of treatment in disorders
that are subject to mental influ
ence, but great caution and expert
knowledge are required in order
to render its employment safe.
No person should ever submit
to hypnotic influence except under
the advice of a regular physician
of the highest standing, and at the
hands of a practitioner concerning
whose motives and capability there
can bo no question. Amateur ex
perimentation with this strange
power is perilous and should al
ways be avoided.
There Is undoubtedly c great
amount of quackery abroad in con
nection with hypnotism, and while
I believe that it is capable of ren
dering immense service to man
kind, yet it is still but partially
developed as a subject of scien
tific study, and the number of
those who can be trusted to apply
it, as well as the number of ac
credited physicians who would
even undertake to apply it, is
small. But this Is not to say that
its methods when fully developed
and understood may not become a
very important branch of medical
practice.
It has been proved that the hyp
notic State can be indueed in the
majority of persons who willingly
submit to it, but it is doubtful
whether any person can be hypno
tized against his vill. A state of
complete confidence between the
operator and the patient must be
established as a preliminary. That
being done, It Is said that hardlv
10 per cent of those experimented
upon prove refractory to hypnotic
influence.
Its Value Already Proved
As Mental Remedy and
Prophylactic.
The valuable feature of hypno
tism is found in the suggestions
tending toward healthy conditions
which can be imparted to the hyp--notlzed
subject without his being
conscious of their origin after
awakening from the trance. It is
somewhat as If, by the temporary
arrest of his external conscious
ness, his body were transformed
into a mere machine, whose bent
cogs and pinions can then be re
dressed and oiled without his
knowledge, so that after he has
come to himself again and resumed
his normal life he finds the mech
anism working better.
All that the operator has really
done is to correct abnormal habits
by suggestions conveyed to the
nervous system of l" patient
P. S-e x v i s s
when the latter is in a state of
recepUveness freed from the dis
tractions of waking life. Mani
festly, only diseases that are asso
ciated In some decided way with
nervous action can come under the
control of hypnotic suggestion,
but such diseases are very numer
ous and of vast importance to
human comfort and happiness.
Pains, especially rheumatic and
neuralgic pains, have been relieved
in this way, and it has been
claimed that such habits as drunk
enness have been cr-ed by hyp
noUc suggestion. Morbid, nerv
ous and bodily tendencies, like in
somnia, hysteria and constipation,
also appear to be amenable to this
treatment.
It might at first slgU be sup
posed that serious mental dis
orders would yield to hypnotic
treatment, but It has been found
that they do not, the apparent
reason being that, since it Is
through the brain that the hyp
notic influence works, it is essen
tial that that organ should be in
sound condition. To vield to hyp
notic treatment is not an indica
tion of mental weakness.
Hypnosis Allied to Sleep,
Although Condition Is
Not Identical
Many theories have been pro
posed to explain hypnotism. In a
general way hypnosis resembles
sleep, and the two states are re
garded as being allied though not
identical. One explanation of hyp
nosis is that under its influence a
state of relative dissociation oc
curs among the brain cells, so that
the operator can accentuate the
activity of certain impressions
without interference through other
nervous links. This would account
for such a phenomenon as the
anesthesia of one evj of the sub
ject while the other remains un
affected. Thus if the operator tells the
subject that he cannot see with
his right eye, but only with his
left one though both eyes be nor
mal and wide open, it will be
found that the ritht eye really
does lose its power of seeing as
completely as if it were actually
blind, until the operator, by a
command, removes the disability.
Telepathy, which has been de
fined as "the conveyance of
thoughts and feelings from mind
to mind by other than the ordinary
channelb of sense," is a phenome
non not well established, like hyp
notism, by experimental evidence.
It has been associated with hyp
notism by attempts to Induce the
hypnotic state in subjects at a dis
tance from the operator. Dr.
Pierre Janet, in Franco, claimed to
have succeeded in nineteen out of
twenty-five attempts of this kind,
while Prof. Richet reported that
in nine attempts he had succeed
ed twice completely and four times
partially. I think that telepathy
has not yet got upon its scientific
legs.</text>

	<text>HYPNOTISM NO LONGER A MYSTERY
What Was Once the Showman's Art Is Now
Explained By Psychologists and Used By
Physicians in Curing Diseases.
Professor Fakirlno, the "World's
Greatest Hypnotist," who visited all
the country towns a quarter of a cen
tury ago, was a mystical looking per
son with flowing black hair and a
"powerful hypnotic eye." Under the
spell of his mysterious words and ges
tures, village youths went Into trances,
and at his suggestion picked apples
from chandeliers, played baseball- with
toothpicks and even proposed to the
homeliest old maids in the audience.
And everybody ccreed that the pro
fessor was a great magician.
Next came the spiritualists, mediums
and clairvoyants. Of course they did
not admit that they used hypnotism.
They did not tell their followers that
they hypnotized them Into hearing
spirit rappings and receiving mes
sages from the dead. They did not
tell them either that the trances Into
which they themselves went were only
self-Induced ypuotlc states. And ev
erybody, according as they believed or
disbelieved, said this was the work
or the Lord or the devil.
And then came science, and with
this hypnotism lost all or Its mystery
and much of Its charm. "Hypnotism,"
said science, "Is only a peculiar con
dition of the nervous system produced
by artificial means. It is a state al
lied to sleep walking. In which the sub
conscious elements are uppermost.
Then science went about establishing
hypnotism on a practical basis and
making it of service in medicine, in
surgery and In detecting crime.
Anyone Can Hypnotize.
But the greatest blow of science to
the old mythical hypnotism was to
shear Professor Fakirlno and his kind
of their power. "Anybody can hypno
tize anybody else," says Dr. Hugo
Munsterberg of Harvard, "just as any
body can fall in love or be loved."
"There Is nothing to this so-called
hypnotic power," says Dr. Max Meyer
of the University. "Anyone can be a
hypnotist. All that is required Is a
little skill, not .any more though than
is needed to become a 'good shoe
maker. It Is just a way of talking and
it is above all self confidence. More
over anybody can hypnotize himself.
All he has to do is to look- steadily
at some object long enough. He may
select a table leg or a more striking
object as a bright crystal. This Is
called 'auto-hypnosls.'
However, some persons are much
more easily hypnotized than others,
a cording to Doctor Meyer. "A per
son who is hypnotized very easily,
must be abnormal," he says. "He Is
hysterical in a high degree. Now, we
are all of us more or less hysterical
although we won't admit It The per
son who is least so is the most difficult
to hypnotize. After a person has been
hypnotized once he is more amenable
to it in the future."
Many of the strange things attribut
ed to hypnotism do not belong to it.
Doctor Meyer believes. The Idea that
It gives certain evil men power to
make women fall in love with them Is
a mistake, he thinks. "Hypnotism Is
too transitory an Influence for that,"
he says. "Besides it does not make
anyone do anything opposed to his na
ture. It would not have made Trilby
a wonderful singer. It usually makes
us do foolish things such as wearing
straw hats in December. However,
many of us do a great many foolish
things even when we are not hypno
tized." Methods Used Are Simple.
There are several methods of hypno
tizing persons. One is to arrest their
attention by a bright object Another
is to make monotonous sleep sugges
lons. IiTboth, the subject's confidence
in the hypnotist must be established
first, for one cannot be hypnotized by
a new person ror the first time
against one's will. The steps in the
process of hypnotism are relaxed eye
muscles, vacant stare, Indolent atten
tion, passive brain, blank mind, re

	<text>PROMINENT PHYSiGIANS'S QUEER
DELUSION; HYPNOTIZES HIMSELF
NEW YORK, May 13.—At his own re
quest Dr. Paul H. Collins, of 408 Central
Park Wept, is now undergoing treatment
at Bellevue hospital tor the strangest
malady, or whatever it might be called,
ill.l the physician.* at that institution
have ever had to (leal with.
He believes that he can hypnotise him
self.
For long be hag delved into the im-!«iie.«
of hypnotism, and it in believed that bis
mind has become so imbued with the sub
ject M to result in a moat singular im
pairment.
On other subjects the unfortunate physi
cian it perfectly rational. Physically his
condition in good. He seem* to realise
that his self-hypnosis is a weird delusion,
a nightmare of a disordered mind, but try
as he will, so far he has been utterly un i
able to rid himself of it.
For a year it has haunted him night and
day. "The end can only be death," he
repeats pathetically. And Dr. Collins I
dreads the very name of death, and, no j
wonder, for he firmly believes that it will
come to him in a ghastly manner.
"I will gome day hypnotize myself." li« i
tells the hospital physicians, "into a state
of coma, and then be buried alive.'' This
dread thought is with him ever.
Dr. Parker, head of the psychopathic
ward, is unable to state what will be the
ultimate result of this strange case. The
alienist does not believe self-hypnosis pos
sible.
To your correspondent he said: "There
is do authenticated record of inch a thing.
It i- ,c remarkable delusion, more remark
able in the Fact that on oilier subject*
Dr. Collins can converse sanely, even bril
liantly. As for hit- intense fear of death
any one would have that who carried con
stantly with him the braln-rnking idea
that his certain fate- was to "be buried
alive."
Other members of the medical profession
■who have known Dr. Collins in the past,
state that he has been a great student, lias
ample funds, and is of a liberal mind and
generous disposition. He is a big man,
aged somewhere in the titties, and has
never married. His mother lives in the
northern part of New York state. His
brother is in Buffalo.
When Dr. Collins went to the hospital
he astonished Dr. Parker by exclaiming:
"I am .1 doctor, like yourself, and I want
you to thoroughly examine me and tell me
whether I am going crazy."
"What seems to be the trouble?" asked
Dr. Parker.
And then came the story that reminds
one sonic of Jekyl and Hyde. Dr. Collins
told how he had studied deeply into he
art of hypnotism anil had attained remark
able success in its practice. He went on:
'•Finally came the time when I discov
ered that I could sit alone and hypnotize
myself. The sensation is indescribable</text>

	<text>HYPNOTISM IN A VERY PAINFUL DENTAL OPERATION
Bvj a J4ere WaVe of tke jiarxd Ir\ter\se
Suffering Was pVeVerxted
In the rooms of the Stomatological Club,
at Post and Stockton streets, on Tuesday
afternoon last, a clinic was held in the
presence of nearly all the members, in i
which hypnotism was introduced as a sub
stitute for anesthesia.
It was an experiment and the experi
ment was successful in the highest degree,
insomuch that it is safe to say that it
fixes the date of a subsidence of old and
the beginning of entirely new methods in
the operating-rooms of San Francisco
dentists.
Hypnotism is not a new thing in dentis
try any more than it is in therapeutics. It
has just landed in San Francisco, how
ever preceded, to be sure, by tales of
great successes in Paris, Berlin, London
and New York. That San Francisco
dentists are fully alive to the progress that
has been making in their science and
eager to keep the best pace that is being
made in the world was made evident by
the number in attendance and the inter
est manifested in the clinic
The demonstration was arranged by Dr.
M. W. Levkowicz. His subject was a boy
of 17, Alfred Boulton, a native of Victoria,
B. C, but who has returned but a few
weeks from a residence of some years in
Honolulu. He was an admirable subject
for a test of the possibilities of applied
hypnotism, in that he was a bright-eyed,
intelligent lad of nervous temperament,
and in that he had a couple of very sore
teeth.
J. B. Earley, a teacher of hypnotism,
was present to make the magic passes and
show the congregated doctors how easily
it might be done. The clinic began
shortly after 4 o'clock, the subject or pa
tient being placed in the red-plush chair,
so full of terrors to the tooth-aching con
tingent, and all of which tenors were to
be driven away by the wave of a hand.
But tne thing was an experiment, and
the terrors have been long intrenched in
tnat red-plush chair. Tney laughed at
this mild attempt to dislodge them— at
first they did.
The chair was placed in a wide bay-win
dow that extends out from an upper floor
immediately at the corner— the southeast
corner of Post and Stockton streets. There
was plenty of light and platform steps sur
rounded the chair, and on these the mem
bers of tie society were gathered, full of
interest. The boy took his place and Pro
fe^-sor Earley told him to close his ejea.
He did so. ''You cannot open them,"
said the professor, and he could not.
"Open them," said the professor, and be
did "Piace your hand! together— there;
you cannot take them apart," and he
could not.
"Now when I count ten you will be
sound asleep and your sense ol feeling
will have entirely left you, bo that you
wili feel no »aia."
The professor counted ten slowly and
deliberately. The boy waited a moment
and then opened bis eyes, quite es wide
awake as before. The professor smiled re
assuringly and placing his hands upon
the boy's head, with his thumbs at the
bridge of the nose, repeated his statement
in quiet confidence. Still the boy looked
up with wide-awake eyes. The terror of
the red cliair was upon him.
Two or three times the charm was tried
again, but it would not work. The doctors
watched and waited patiently enough, but
their comments and discussions, however
quiet, were distracting. The professor
saw his influence slipping away. He took
the boy out of the red chair and led him
to a rocter in the corner, as unlike the red
cbair as possible.
Still the boy's eyes H
would open. It be-
gan to look like a ,fl
I hopeless case. The J
I doctors broke up in jl
j knots and talked of
I other things.
Finally it was SU2- I
gested that the pro- I
fessor lake the sub- I
ject into a room I
I apart and to them- I
selves. He did so and I
the doctors waited I
waited quite a little I
j while. Then the sep- I
arating door opened I
and the doctor en- I
tered, leading the I
boy, his eyes fast H
shut, impossible for I
him to open them, I
but still not asleep. I
He was led to the I
chair, and the profes- I
sor told the doctors I
to go ahead.
"This boy is not I
asleep," said the pro- I
fessor. 'He is in a I
semi-conscious state, I
but he has nofeelin.-. I
You can work witli I
him with perfect free- I
dom." He spoke to I
the boy. "Now. my I
boy, you will feel no I
pain whatever. Do I
not think of the den- I
tist; think of me; no I
harm will come to I
I you; you need have I
Ino fear; lie there I
quietly and dream I
pleasant dreams."
Dr. Levkowicz be- I
gan to work with no I
more ado. The boy I
responded to his in- I
structions, opening I
his mouth wide and I
holding it as desired. I
He had what the den- I
tists call a "fungoid I
growm 01 me pulp
of a back molar. rffi^^s^^^^^^he
"nerve," as it is popularly called, was ex
posed and had filled up the large cavity of
a decayed tooth.
As explained afterward by the doctor
"This is a most sensitive and painful con
dition. To touch such a tooth under or
dinary conditions will cause great pain,
and dentists do not attempt to work with
such a tooth until after two or three days,
and then with iodine and arsenic The

THE LAST BOAT
pulp bleeds prof us°ly upon tne slightest
touch. Now, I wished to demonstrate
that with the patient under the influence
of hypnotism this painful and distressing
growth could be removed quickly and
without pain."
The doctor began digging into the sensi
tive tooth with his cold steel instruments
with speedy and certain touch. In fifteen
minutes the growth had been wholly re-

moved and the cavity made clean for a
fiiling. And during those fifteen minuted
the boy lay in the chair apparently as
comfortable as though he were enjoying
a siesta in a hammock. The professor
had said at the beginning that there
j would be a minimum of blood flow from
i the operation. The doctor took up what
little there was in the customary way with
I small pellets of absorbent cotton in the
I tooth. One of the doctors remarked that
there seemed to be a good deal of saliva
in the mouth. "I will stop it," said the
professor, and he did so by merely speak
in^ the word.
When it was finished and the doctors
had examined and approved and mar
veled at the demonstration, the boy said,
"I would like to open my eyes."
"Oh, certainly," said the professor, "you
may open your eyes, but you will still re
main without pain without being sus
ceptible to pain."
The boy opened his eyes— as clear and
as intelligent as when he had closed them.
Then Doctor Frank 8. Pague stepped up
with a pair of forceps and from the other
side of the afflicted mouth he pulled a
tooth. It was well planted and resisted
at first and broke off. The doctor took
another hold, pushed the forceps down
hard upon the fragment remaining,
twisted it in tbe fetching way that dentists
have, until it yielded and came out. It
was then discovered to have an ulcerated
root.
"That should hurt you, boy."
"Should it?" he answered.
"Didn't you feel it?"
"Oh, yes; I felt you were pulling my
tooth, but it did not hurt."
"Such a tooth ordinarily is very painful
in being drawn," explained the doctor.
J\ Remarkable Derr\or\stratior\ of tke
JMystericxis Sciervce
"For fifteen minutes, and sometimes an
hour, alter pulling an ulcerated tooth the
patient usually suffers greatly. It is cer
tainly a convincing demonstration of the
great beneficence of hypnotism in den
tistry that this patient did not. Further
more, I felt his pulse when he took a seat
in the chair under the hypnotic influence
and it was beating wildly. During the
progress of this ordinarily painful opera-
tion it quieted down until it became en
tirely normaL"
But this was not the end of the demon
stration. The operation for the day being
finished, the boy said, "1 would like
to be released now; I want my sense of
feeling."
"Certainly," said the professor, "I will
give you that again." But to show the
doctors that the subject's entire body was
without feeling he ran a needle through
the flesh of the arm and drew it away
without any blood following.
"Now," he said, "you have your sense
of feeling all except in your teeth ttat
have been operated upon. Tney will re
main painless until the operation is over
and they have healed up. You are to go
up to Dr. Levkowicz' office to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock and this tooth will
be filled. It will give you no pain what-
ever remember
I that. Now you have
sense of feeling
Hagain except as 1
Hhave said."
The clinic being at
Han end a general dis-
Heussion of the mys-
Htery of hypnotism
Hran on for some time.
I"I will show you,"
Hsaid Professor Earley,

I patient to the influ-

Herat ion is removed.
HaII the surroundings
I were beiore alarming
H and distracting.
H>'ow, my boy," said
I the professor, ad-
H dressing young 80l-
Hton, "take that chair
I over there in the cor-
I ncr as far from me
las you can get. Sit
Hdown. That's right.
Bw'hen I count ten
Hyou will be sound

I sor coanted ten and
I the boy was I asleep. He was put

I that it was so.
B "Now," said the
Hproiessor, "when you
Ha wake and have
Hialked with these gen-
Htienien in your nor-
Hmal condition you
Hwill fall asleep again
Himmediately upon
Hseein? me draw my
H watch from my pock-
Het. "Then the pro-
Hfessor snapped his
H ringers and told him
Htowakeup. He came
Hto instantly, lie was
H questioned as to how
Ihe lelt and the con-
Hversation became
Hg ener al. Professor
Earley casually drew his watch while
the boy was looking his way, and
the latter instantly dropped over asleep.
The doctors present, as stated, made them
selves certain that the demonstration was
in all particulars just what it seemed.
On Wednesday rooming young Boulton
went to the office of Dr. Levkowicz
and bad that sensitive tooth filled without
feeling any pain, the "post hypnotic sug
gestion," as they call it, holding good.
All the dentists present at the clinic and
aware of the circumstances are agreed
that the results are nothing less than
wonderful and that they mean a revolu
tion in the science of dentistry.
"It means that by a wave of the hand a
patient having a painful operation to go
through may be set at ease. It means
much for both the dentist and the suffer
ing public," said one of them.
The Stomatological Club is a rather ex
clusive organization and its members were
at first blush greatly opposed to having the
fact made public that it had lent itself to
a countenancing of hypnotism. Dr.
Levkowicz explained this feeling:
"We know, as scientific men, the trend
of the times and the necessity of keeping
pace with them if we are to keep in the
race at all. Dr. Bernheim's work in the
hospitals of France is familiar to all well
informed practitionera his success, the
wonderful results he has attained. We
know also the charlatanism that obtains in
this mystic art, and we know that the pub
lic at large, generally less well informed in
scientific matters than the practitioner, is
inclined to be wary of men whopraciice it.
While we feel it our duty to investigate it
we do not wish the impression to go
abroad that the members of the Stomato
logical Club are rushing into hypnotism
as a fad. We approach the subject with
the conservative care of a scientific propo
sition. We feel that it would be a great
beneficence to a patient if the pain of the
dentist's chair might be done away with
by a word. But, while we have had a
number of experiments of the kind at the
clubrooms, I am free to say that this of
Professor Earley is the only one that has
proved entirely convincing as to the util
ity of hypnotism in the science of den
tistry. All persons may not be hypno
tized, however. Dr. Bumheim himself, I
believe, brings under the influence only
about 80 per cent of those he attempts.
And, at all events, the consent of the
patient must be obtained. As I say, with
the Stomatological Club it is a scientific
experiment."
Following were the members of the club
who were present at the clinic; Clinician,
M. W. Levkowicz; William J. Younger,
president of the club; Russell H. Cool,
vice-president; S. E. Knowles, secretary;
Thomas Morffew, treasurer; Luther A.

Pague, J. L. Asay, Max Sichel, Alfred
Cane, H. D. Boyes, F. K. Ledyard.
As for Professor J. B. Parley, who
worked the strange influence, he is a new
comer to the City. He is a man of slight
figure and quiet manner, wearing the ap
pearance of the student. His voice is low
and kindly rather than stern and com
manding. His eyes and the expression of
his face are calm and reassuring. He said
"I cannot attempt to explain the mystery of
hypnotism any more than Edison will try
to tell you what electricity is," he said.</text>

	<text>HYPNOTISM IS DYNAMITE
Quack hypnotists are claiming they can cure everything
from insomnia to alcoholism, but how do they pay off?
With misery and suffering. Here is the story of a
growing menace that the law doesn’t touch
by Ward Cannel and Leonard A. Paris
You have a persistent backache. It robs you of deep.
It makes your waking hours miserable. Nothing
seems to help. Then (me day you see an advertisement:
“Hypnotism can cure." You decide to try it.
What’s wrong with that? Plenty, according to medical
and psychiatric authorities.
There are indications that hypnotism can cure under
certain conditions. But hypnosis is one of the least known
and understood of all the healing arts. And in the hands
of amateurs, it can be downright dangerous.
Yet thousands of Americans are seeking cures for
everything from neuroses to narcotics addiction at the
hands of amateur hypnotists who practice at home.
These same Americans would shrink with horror from
the thought of going to an unlicensed physician or a
psychiatrist without formal trashing. But because hyp
notism is fast becoming a cure-all racket, more and more
people are willing to put their trust in men who promise
everything and don’t ask too many questions.
Consider the case of Mrs. W., an Arizona housewife
who turned to hypnotism for relief horn insomnia. She
had suffered sleepless nights for months, she said. But
the “magic” of hypnotism gave her rest
She found out later that it was a small lump in her
breast that had caused her restless nights. She had a
tumor, and immediate surgery not hypnotic deep
was the answer. The tumor had spread unnoticed be
cause hypnotism had blotted out the symptoms.
Her surgeon pointed out that his fee for saving her life
was only a fraction of what she had paid the amateur
hypnotist.
Dr. Lewis Wolberg, a pioneer in psychiatric hypnosis,
deplores such tragedies. “Hypnotic suggestion can suc
ceed as a cure for mental illness," he points out, “only
if it is performed by a skillful psychiatrist.”
Part of the tragedy is that untrained practitioners are
actually holding back the progress of hypnotic therapy.
10
By trying to cadi in on scientific advances, they are im
planting doubt and fear in the minds of the public.
Yet these amateur hypnotists are still practicing, and
it is problematical whether they can be stopped. Every
year they are crippling thousands of people, but unless
someone complains that they are violating the law by
promising cures for specific ailments, nothing is done.
Psychiatric and medical associations have attempted to
get legislation requiring licenses for hypnotists. But a
high official of such a group admitted failure. “How
can you legislate against talk?" he asked. “Hypnotists
aren’t talking against the government. They’re merely
advocating cures. And the terrible part is that they be
lieve what they’re saying."
You will find their advertisements everywhere. They
are people like your neighbors insurance agents or
clerks or automobile salesmen or store owners.
Da. Milton Ebkxson, a prominent psychiatrist who has
used hypnotic therapy for 20 years, finds growing cause
for alarm. He ays, "The lay hypnotist can do irreparable
harm by his ability to produce hypnotic effects which he
doesn’t understand and doesn’t know how to use."
In the larger cities there are schools and institutes
dedicated to the study of hypnotism and hypnotic cures.
Tuition is usually SSO for 10 lessons and a diploma. Pri
vate lessons cost S2OO or more. A Midwestern hypnotist
was charging SSOO to teach hypnotism to a woman
whom be could not hypnotize himself.
In one neat suburban home, a salesman had turned
his cellar into a hypnotism clinic. His advertisement in

	<text>hypnotism is nearly synony?
mous with mesmerism, animal magnet?
ism, braidism ami syggignoscisia. Hyp?
notism bs believe*] t<> have been practiced
by religionist's many centuries ago, but
little, however, is known of its history
previous to the time of Mesmer (177$).
Since then hypnotism has been much
studied by many eminent mon in the
professions of medicine, science, religion
and tile arts. There carno a time when
the interest in it flagged very greatly;
but a few years ago a revival took pince
in Pram:??, and since then it lias l>eon
generally recognized as a.*therapeutic
agent and employed by many physicians
ail over the world. One of tho earliest
uses of hypnotism was to produce as?ate
cf insensibility, so that surgical opera?
tions could IK.* perforated without pain,
But it has been applied for many other
purposes, and some men, very skillful in
its application, use it in the treatment of
a long list .of diseurs both acute and
chronic. ?S^fo^s Ja-?rections sometimes
yield very readily to its influence,
now PRODUCED.
To produce hypnotism, operators have
methods which vary somewhat in detail,
but the principle is the same. Most all
use passes, although some depend almost
entirely, if not entirely, upon the fixa?
tion of gaze*.. For reasons which will
appear anon, none of the methods em?
ployed to produce the hypnotic state will
be described in tIiis communication. As
to the force generated or liberated in
hypnotism, no one pretends to know;
but many believe it to be electric, or
perhaps magnetic. According to one
observer, the.i description, "the subjects
give of their sensations is that they first
feel their lingers tingle and their hands
pnd feet get -cold; thea." they, become
sleepy; and when told that-they cannot
open their eyes, tiny say they hear and
know all, but cannot open them; then
comes deep"_sl.e?p*" unless it is desired to
extract a tooth or do some other such
.work when the subject is not entirely
unconscious. Then they know and do
as bidden, but suffer no pain. They say
if the skin is cut it feels as ii something
were being gently drawn over it. and
they fee! the forceps applied to the tooth,
but that pulling the tooth feels like pull?
ing a peg out of a hole.
As to the value of hypnotism as a
remedial agent, there is necessarily much
difference of opinion. Some physicians
consider its range a very limited one,
.?bile others tliink it applicable to a long
list of affections. The majority of those
who ought to know best appear to agree
that it will undoubtedly prove of very
great service in properly selected cases
in medical practice. As for its usc in
surgical operations, as a substitute for
gas, ether or chloroform, it car never
displace them to more than a very slight
extent, except, perhaps, it be with chil?
dren. Very many who are about to have
?ja operation performed must necessarily
be so nervous that hypnotism will be
quite out of the question.
And there will doubtless always exist
persons who will be insensible to the
efforts of operators. Some subjects are
easy to hypnotize, while with others it is
tlie reverse; to which of these classes a
person belongs cannot bo known until
an effort to put him into the hypnotic
state is made. And in the susceptible
cases not infrequently several seances
are necessary before the power of the
operator is sui?icient?y felt.
One very im??or;a::t point that thc-
study of hypnotism has brought out and
emphasized, says an observer, is the po- j
tency of suggestion. Doubtle; s most of
the slight aches and pains that the gen- 1
eral practitioner is called upon to treat
are partly imaginary, and all that is
necessary for cure, is a certain amount
of faitil on thc part of the patient, be- j
gotten bv judicious suggestion b\ the
medical man. At iirst sight this seems j
to be a sort of chicanery, bat it is impos- i
siblc to deny its eficacy., a:jd it is much j
safer for thc doctor to acimowledge, to j
himself at least, that it is noi his .simple
remedy which has wrought the cure,
but his suggestion to the patient. One
needs no better example of the power of j
suggestion than the many cures brought
about by thc faith cure. In this case j
religious fanaticism is called upon to j
produce an effect upon the mind the
credulous patient, and if the malad y is I
an imaginary ono the relief is instanta?
neous.
We now come to the reason why none
of the methods employed to produce j
hypnotism have been herein described, j
It is an ?agent which only should bc used j
by reputable physicians, for, like others
which they employ, it will do much harm
if injudiciously applied. Were the moth- j
Otis known, there would naturally :>e a
tendency on the part of some to try it as j
a means of amusement, while, without
doubt, there are not a few who would j
use it for no good purpose. Thathypno- j
tism may l>o rightly applied and without
injury it must bo exclusively coniined to j
physicians, who alone are capable of dis-
tinguishing between those subjects upon j
which it is likely to do good and thos?
likely to be injured by it. It is a well
known fact that persons who are often j
hypnotized finally become sc? susceptible
that the act is accomplished with ibo
greatest ease. And in not a few in?
stances of subjects so treated for a long
time, it requires scarcely more than a
single glance for the operator to throw j
them int?? a hypnotic sleep.
So it will be seen that hypnotism might
provea menace to society unless steps
were taken to guard against it. The iirst
precaution to suggest itself is the prohibi?
tion of ail publie exhibitions of hypno?
tism or mesmerism. This remarkable
power should, if possible^ be limited by
law to the treatment of disease. And
the operator should be permitted to in?
fluen?a his subject only as health may
be improved.-Boston Herald</text>

	<text>TO REFORM MEN BY
USE OF HYPNOTISM
.New Field for Philanthropic Endeavor
Just Discovered.
QUICK RELIEF FOR OPIUM FIENDS
Alto lor Person Addicted to the Ei
ccesive Use or Alcholic Liquors and
Tobacco-.Somi'thinx Which it Im
portant if True and Interesting
Anyhow.
If we may believe In the Times-Herald
of Chicago, hypnotism similar to
that practiced by the Sages will soon
be put to a new use. It Is to be en
listed In the reformation of mankind.
The expert who has this aim in view is
named Brouyette, who lives in Engle
wood, a suburb of Chicago. Says the
Chicago paper:
"Any pedestrian or trolley car pas
fenger passing along South Halsted
street in the vicinity of Sixtieth will
hardly fall to notice a big yellow sign
fastened to the side of a house which
proclaims to the Englewood prohibi
tionists and all the wayfarers who
chance to travel in that dry district
these glad tidings:
HYPNOTISM
Cures liquor, morphine, to.
bacco, cigarette, and all use-
less habits. Stammering in
speech, catching of the breath,
etc. 1 remove all Ideas that
cause trouble.
"If any man Is a slave of drink let
him consult hypnotism and there And
a panacea. Hypnotism In its modern
phases has accomplished wonders.
There has never yet ben discovered a
man who could put an idea Into an
empty head; but here In Chicago this
young man has come to light who, for
a considerations, offers to remove all
ideas of a troublesome nature.
"Never before has any man set him
self up to. accomplish these things
through the mysterious forces of hyp
notism. But now there has arisen this
young man, who claims he Is not only
able to remove all troublesome Ideas,
but who says he is specially endowed
with the powers that will set a man free
from whisky, morphine, cigarettes, or
plug tobacco. In France this science of
hypnotism is much better understood
than It Is here; but this boy not only
studied here but accomplished some of
his most wonderful results among the
friends who knew him best.
WHAT HE HAS DONE.
"For example, he recently took as a
patient a young man who was addict
ed to tobacco. This young man was in
thi habit of smoking 150 cigarettes In
a day. After placing him In achatr and
waving hlB hands over him In mesmeric
fashion, he told him to go to sleep. Im
mediately the subject fell under the In
fluence of the hypnotist, and seem.jl
to. be under complete control. The
welrdness of the hypnotist now became
apparent. Nothing could be seen but
the glitter of hid big black eyes and
sinuous movements of his Ions, skeleton-like
arms. Soon the patient was
apparently In a sound sleep.
"The cigarette tierJ was then asked
if he would like to smoke. Of course
he would like to smoke. And the hyp
notist handed him a lead pencil, which
he smoked with manifestations of the
greatest enjoyment.' Then the hypnot
ist passed his hands over his subject's
fare. In the same mesmeric manner.
and said 'Wake un,' which the young
man did without delay. He was again
pat to sleep and told that smoking was
injurious, that he would no longer de

sire to smoke after waking. This was
the mode of treatment.
"In the next place a man with a bis
bottle nose and a strong whisky breath
was brought before the hypnotist,
rpon examination it appeared the bottle-nosed
man had been drinking twenty-three
years. Professor Uruuyette
put him in the catatleptic state in a
few minutes, by a little waving of the
hands, or what some Ignorant people
call pow-wowlng. Then he said: 'Here
is a glass of whisky,' when as a mut
ter of fact It was nothing but a gluss
of water. He drank the water with
as much relish as If it had been old
Kentucky whisky. Then the hypnotist
said: 'What I'm giving you Is injuri
ous to your health; you must give It up;
it is killing you. When you wake uu
all desire for it will be gone.i The sub
ject was brought out of his trance.
Thereupon the lecturer described to his
subject all the evils of Intemperance
and told him how to gut rid of trouble.
THE TOBACCO HABIT.
The hypnotist In the next case took a
young man who had been a slave to
plug tobacco for fifteen years. He put
him under the hypnotic Influence with
out the least difficulty, and then offered
him an ordinary business card, telling
him it was the finest brand of tobacco.
The patient Immediately began to bite
and chew this card as If It had been
the finest tobacco In the world, wen
the hypnotist said: 'How do you like
that?' 'That's fine tobacco.'
'Well,' said the hypnotist, 'I want
to help you; I want to cure you of the
tobacco habit; it is injuring you; It is
destroying your health. Now, I want
to tell you that you don't want any
more tobacco; you don't desire It any
more, do you? You wouldn't take a
chew now if you could, would you?'
"In this way, says Professor Brouy
ette, the desire for habits that are in
jurious are removed. In regard to how
soon he can accomplish a cure, it is
all owing, he says, to the temperament
of the patient. Sometimes, he claims,
he can cure a slave In one or two treat
ments, and then again there are cases
which require from three to ten treat
ments. Of course, where a habit ihas
been fixed on a man for several years,
he says, you would not expect It to be
removed in a minute. Habits are of
slow growth, but they become second
nature to a man. Habits often lead a
man tojhe grave.
"Professor Brouyette said that of all
the (lends he has ever had to treat the
morphine fiend Is the worst. In a case
where a man has been using morphine
or opium iq any form for any great
length of time. It requires the greatest
skill In judgment and often weeks in
treatment before he can get them di
vorced from their trouble. It la a great
thing to remove Ideas that trouble the
mind.
"Hypnotism, according to Professor
Brouyette, Is a thing that anybody can
practice, but not all with the same de
gree of success. He made a study of
the science under an advanced teacher
right here In Chicago. He says that
almost every person Is able to hyp
notise a man or woman that is amen
amble; and then again there are other
operators who have much more mag
netic power. So far as he himself Is
concerned, he Is able to put nine per
sons out of every ten under the hyp
notic Influence. This is his record.
There la nothing new In the bare Idea
of hypnotism. But never before has a
man advertised that he would cure
liquor, morphine, and tobacco habits
by the application of this science. He
claims to have cured a good many pa
tients troubled with these different
complalntc.
AN INTERESTING CASE.
"Professor Etrouyette tells of one
case that Is very Interesting. A lady
of great wealth, whose husband was
one of the most prominent business
men In this city, had secretly become
a slave to the morphine habit. She
had tried all kinds of remedies and
fealed. She was In despair. She went
to Europe and visited thtf different re
sorts and consulted the most famous

physiciuns. Then at last she heard
of this hypnotism and tried It. The re
sult was that inside of a fortnight she
was cured, and she has been free from
this habit ever since.
"There are two cardinal principles In
my method of treatment,' said Profes
sor Brouyette. 'The first Is. as I have
already remarked, that whilu the pa
tient is In a cataleptic state I remove
all desire from the mind for the particu
lar form of indulgence with which he
or she has become allllcted. I do this
In an impressive and permanent way
that Is only known to one who prac
tices hypnotism. In the next place,
when I bring the patient out of the
cataleptic state. I carefully explain the
evil effects of the habit and leave na
ture to build up the broken system.
Sometimes this can be done in a single
treutnient, then again a caes may re
quire several treatments. But the one
fixed Idea which I never allow to de
part from the patient's mind is that the
desire is gone, and gone to stay for
ever. As soon as nature has done her
part, in restoring the dilapidated func
tions there Is no more danger of the
patient's returning to the habit than
there was before he had first begun to
Indulge it.'
Professor Brouyette has a good many
funny experiences In removing trouble
some ideas from the minds of some of
the persons who call upon him.
One day last week he received a call
from a young woman who wanted to
get rid of the Idea that she was de
stined to become an old maid. After
applying the mesmeric force he had no
dlltlculty In convincing her that her
notion was erroneous that she would
be a happy bride at 25 and that her hus
band would be a rich man. There was
not a happier young woman In all En
glewood the next day. She was so elat
ed that she told her friends about the
seance, and thus the secret leaked out.
One treatment was sufficient In her
case.
Perhaps the most remarkable case
which has yet come within the young
hypnotist's experience is that of a man
who lately consulted him In order to
escape from the idea which had fixed
Itself on his mind that he was about
to commit an unconscious murder. This
man was in no way vicious, nor was
he an Inebriate, though it may be that
he was on the borderland of Insanity
over business troubles. At any rate he
became sleppless over the Idea that he
was In danger of murdering a fellow
man without knowing it. Professor
Brouyette still has this strange patient
in charge, and Is confident of affecting
a cure.</text>

	<text>ALCOHOLISM IN RUSSIA.
Inebriates in the Realm of the
C2ar Are Treated by
Hypnotism.
1 'ISl
ff
Of
That alcoholism in Russia is widely
treated with success by hypnotism is
assorted by the writer of a note in
Cosmos. The method lias been attest
ed in government institutions, but it
is believed that the peculiar adapta
bility of the Russians to this mode ol
treatment is largely responsibly for it
good effects. Says the writer:
"The cure of alcoholism by means ui
hypnotism is the order of the day. Re
cently Pr. l.cgrain communicated to th
Society of Hypnology and Psychology
some ery intrif Fting information re
garding the treatment of alcoholics b;
hypnotism in Russia. In the cities ol
St. Petersburg, Moscow, Jaroslav, Kielf
Saratoff and Astrakhan there have been
established for several years, under gov
ernment auspices, dispensaries tc
which the sufferers resort by hundreds
and where hypnotism is the principal
if not the sole, therapeutic agent. It U
required of the alcoholics that they de
sire sincerely to be cured, and that thej
abstain from all spirituous liquors dur
ing the period of treatment. This is per
bapstoask of them a colossal effort, sincf
their will-power has generally been de
stroyed; but they are obliged to accept
a continual surveillance, and it is attempted-to
ameliorate their conditions
of life as much as possible. These mean.'
succeed very well in Russia; but, as ha
often been remarked, the French drink
er is much less tractable, and eonse
fluently the cure of alcoholics in Francf
is much more difficult and much les
durable than iu Russia; with us, In fact
the alcoholic poisons himself with es
sences as various as they are injurious
and it Is only exceptionally that he sub
mits to treatment for a long enougl.
time to effect a lasting cure. It ii
none the less true that at the presem
time hypnotism is almost the sole means
of cure for alcoholic mania."</text>
