famous mile runner, kept with Gray, of
St. George's Athletic club, of New

point McDermott came up and after
a sharp race with Gray to Newton Up

ANEW record in the history of
western athletics was made yes
terday by runners in the Los An
geles to Venice Marathon race, given
under the auspices of the Los Angeles
Athletic club.
The race is distinctly the classic
athletic event of the coast. Eleven of
the twenty-three racers participating
lowered the former record, and George
B. Miller, winner of yesterday's con
test, covered the distance of 15% miles
in 1 hour and 41 seconds, a record which
future runners will find it difficult to
lower.
Miller's success was a surprise to all,
as no one had selected him as a likely
winner, and his name did not appear
among those who had been picked by
enthusiasts as probable winners. In
fact, he had not expected to win, and
had entered the race only to see what
he could do.
Finishing strong at the tape, Miller
did not seem to be much tired. Clad
in his running clothes, he conversed
with admiring spectators, while others
who had participated were being helped
tj dressing rooms where medical as
sistance was rendered.
Miller is a carpenter and lives at 749
San Julien street, Los Angeles. He is
26 years old and married. It is by mere
chance he entered the race. He was
urged by W. Burness, his trainer an-i
a man of many years' experience in
racing circles, to compete. Burness
had observed the young man had shown
great endurance when they went into
the country for tramps over the hills,
and he urged him to enter the race.
Miller is not a runner, never had taken
part in a race and had been trained
for a month only. This training he
did after working- hours, for he had
been engaged regularly at his trade
up to the time of the race. He n^ver
had run more than ten miles at one
time previous to the contest of yester
day.
Miller did not want to enter the race
because he had no running shoes and
because he thought he had no chance
to win; but his trainer persisted and
so he listed his name, saying he would
"just try it and see if he could stay
with the runners for a few miles."
Surpasses Expectations
Many persons thought the former
record of 2:01:30, made by Edward
Dietrich in September, would be low
ered ten minutes in yesterday's con
test. A few even ventured to assert
they thought it would be lowered fif
teen minutes. No one was so opti
mistic 2« to suggest that twenty min
utes would be taken from the estab
lished record. Miller lowered the rec
or 1 twenty minutes and thirty seconds
surpassing the most liberal predic
tions.
Miller averaged 6 minutes and 45
seconds a mile for the entire distance
The first four runners averaged better
than 7 minutes a mile. Considering the
condition of the course and the dis
tance, this is a remarkable record. Five
minutes is not considered slow time for
a mile run on a cinder path, where
contestants use spiked running shoes.

By this comparison it readily can be
seen the pace set by the leaders was a
difficult one to maintain.
Practically every man of the twen
ty-three who started, exterted his ut
most to the end. There were few mis
l ps and all but three of the con
testants covered the entire course to
V-nice. Some of the veteran runners
who thought they were certain to win
are somewhat disgruntled at having a
new man, without any records to his
credit, take away the laurels.
From beginning to end the race was
as manly an exhibition of sportsman
ship as ever has been witnessed on
this coast. There is but little doubt
that the Marathon race will become an
annual event and that runners from
every part of the United States will
come to take part in it. It will grow
in importance as an athletic contest
until it shall attract national and
worldwide attention and be looked for
ward to as an event of first importance
in long distance road racing.
Thousands of persons lined the
course of the race, both inside and
outside the city limits, to see the run
ners pass by. Every man was num
bered so he could be picked out by
those having one of the lists published
in the daily newspapers. A small
army of wheelmen followed the racers
for the entire distance, shouting words
of encouragement to favorites. Dozens
of automobiles, carrying friends of the
runners and officials of the course,
followed the contestants.
Thousands View Contest
The start was made at the Los An
geles Athletic club, at 534 South Spring
street, promptly at 9:35 o'clock, a. m.,
when R. A. Rowan, president of the
club, flred the starting gun. Hundreds
of persons blocked Spring street to see
the start, and some of the runners were
cheered by organized bands of their
friends. So numerous was the crowd
the runnei-s had difficulty in getting a
start, and there was much delay before
the contestants finally ran into the

open in front of the Hotel Hayward
and settled into their paces.
In less than five minutes the partici
pants had spread out for a distance
of several hundred yards. The dis
tance apart became greater as the
race progressed, and at the finish the
men were scattered widely along the
course.
Edward Dietrich, champion of the
last race and first winner of The Her
ald cup, began to breathe heavily a.t
Eleventh street, much to the conster
nation of the many persons who had
looked on him as a sure winner. If
there was any general favorite in the
race. Dietrich was that man, largely be
cause of his previous record. It was a
surprise to everyone to see him giv
ingl out at the first.
For some weeks the former cham
pion has been suffering with a severe
cold. He found at the beginning of
the race he could not breathe through
his nostrils, and his efforts to get
sufficient air through his mouth soon
told on him. He ian close to Isaacs
until Adams street was reached. It
was pure grit which carried him on
from that point. He gave up before
reaching Hoover street, his follower
draging him from the street and call
ing for medicnl assistance.
From Hoover to Western the con
testants were scattered over the entire
distance. Iri Schrag, bearing number
15, reached Western avenue in the lead,
and kept the first place until within
five miles of Venice. William Stanley,
number 10, the San Francisco walker,
held second place at Western avenue.
He kept close to the heels of Scrag, and
the two held the lead until they had
passed the Palms. Here Schrag was
forced to drop behind, and Stanley took
the lead, laughing and jesting with the
followers.
George W. Isaacs, the Los Angeles
Athlotic club runner and athlete, held
fourth place throughout the race and
finished fourth, Miller sprinting ahead
of him in the last few miles. Isaacs
ran a stubbornly fought, consistent race

from start to finish. He did not give
any heed to the followers and specta
tors, but gave his entire attention to
the race. He knew his pace and held
it throughout the contest. He made an
excellent showing against the more
experienced runners, who tried in vain
to distance him.
At the new roadhouse Isaacs passed
White, who had been holding third
place up to that time. He held his new
position until he passed the Palms. Be
tween the Palms and Fredericks Miller
forged ahead of him and Schrag
dropped behind him rapidly to the rear.
M. L. White set the pace for Isaacs
from Hoover street to a point beyond
the six-mile post, when Isaacs took the
lead away from him. White was fol
lowing him closely at Fredericks and
forged ahead in the final grueling
sprint through Venice.
Charles Boscha held fifth place dur
ing the first part of the race. Then his
weak left foot began to trouble him
and he was passed by White, Miller and
Starr at the eleven-mile point. At
Fredericks there were five men ahead
of him. It was by hard exertions that
he made his rebellious foot do duty un
til he crossed the finish line at Venice.
Boscha was in splendid condition, ex
cept for his foot, and he seemed a likely
winner. His race was consistent and
showed headwork as well as physical
ability.
Oliver Starr is another contestant
who ran with his head as well as his
feet. At Western avenue Starr held
eighth place and kept to his pace. Then
he gradually reached sixth place and
held it until he arrived at Fredericks,
when he advanced again to fifth place.
During the final sprint he was unable
to make any gain on his speedy oppo
nents. Starr was followed by an or
ganized bunch of supporters, each wear
ing a large paper star. The men fol
lowed on wheels and cheered on their
favorite, who made an excellent
showing.
Paul Reinwald, the veteran hill
climber, did not make the showing ex-

pected of him. He lost his follower
early in the race and had to rely on
other men for water and attention. A
slight illness on the day before the race
probably contributed to his failure.
V. Newman, the T. M. C. A. runner,
made an excellent showing, although
in no condition for the race. He
weighed 175 pounds and was nearly 15
pounds overweight. Everyone who saw
him predicted he would not reach the
city limits. But he stayed in the race
until within sight of Venice, when his
feet could not withstand the pounding
any longer and he had to stop with
only a mile to the finish line.

Athletic dub, finished BSCOnd; Harry Jensen,
of the Pastime Athletic Club, third, and Patrick
Grant of the Trinity Athletic Club, fourth.
Aside from the actual race Itself the crowd
which saw the contest will go down Into history
as one of the most remarkable ever gathered
'together for an athletic event of modern times.
To begin with, fully sis thousand persons
crowded the galleries and every point of van
tape within the spacious armory* while without
it was a rase of struggling humanity as far as
the eve could reach.
One hundred and sixty-six runners faced the
starter which broke all records in point of
number at least in this part of the country.

limbs'of trees strained to the breaking
nolnt with the weight of the precocious small
boy and a small idea of the demonstration may
be gathered. It was estimated that fully half a
million persons witnessed the race.
At certain points along the route the throngs
would close in so that, despite all efforts of the
police and an army of officials, the principals
barely found space to move. As the favorites
struggled on, accompanied by handlers on
wheels, the former at times found it difficulty
hear a' word of advice, always due to the same
reason— the indescribable discord of an excited
crowd.
That the race is not always to the swift found
another Illustration in the case of James J. Lee,
the Boston runner, who, after leading for seven
teen miles, collapsed, and had to be conveyed to
the armory in an automobile. As the contest
drew to a close it was no uncommon sight to see
tallow faced and leg weary men suddenly reel

History Marathon Running
Thirteen years ago tho first of the
modern Olympiads was held In Athens
Greece The first three men to finish In
the Marathon were Greeks Louis tho
winner was greeted h a shout that
roechoed for miles around tho sta
dium Thousands of foreigners who
wore represented at that International
meet acclaimed Louis a hero It seem
ed proper that a Greek should win
that classic event the Marathon run
And when two other Greeks followed
Louis across tho line In tho stadium It
seemed to bo definitely bottled that In
Greece the greatest distance runners In
the world were bred
It was tho revival ot the Olympic
games at Athens In 1806 that created
jthe recrudescence of Interest In long
distance running as a competitive
I sport Truo tho English revived tho
most ancient and most simple of ath
letic sports about seventy years ago
Prizes were offered In competitions all
over the country and from that time
until tho present England has pro
duced moro good runners than any
other country Tho Englishmen go In
moro for distance running than for
fast work as can bo easily seen from
closo scrutiny qf all tho records for
distance from ono mile up to twenty
After the 1S9G event In Athens tho
world evinced an Interest In Marathon
running Many countries participating
In tho Olympiad took up this branch of
sport and In these countries a new
generation of runners was born Prior
to this tlmo no ono In tho United
Statni offered prizes for men doing the
Marathon distance of 20 miles 355
yards Now tho Marathon Is tho most
talked of Taco In tho world</text>

its kind yet run. There is a purse of
$10,; I for Which long distance runners

This is another proof of the prevalence
of Marathonltla, a disease that tirst
affected the Grwks nearly B0 years be
fore the beginning: of the Christian era.
and which has recently obtained a se
cure grip on Americans in a manner
without precedent in the annals of
amateur sport on this hemisphere.

Hayes, a compara
tively lesser light In
athletic circle* ir
New York, carried
the Stars and
Stripes to victory
by winning the
Marathon in the re
newal of the an
cient Olympic
games In the Lon
don stadium in
1908, he not only
achieved everlast
ing glory for him
self, but caused a
renewal of interest
in lons distance
running the like of
which America has
never known.
Since the triumph
of Hayes nearly
every city in this
country has had
Marathon races.
While it was gen
erally conceded that
the team from the
F. J. Haskln
United States would score an over
whelming victor. In th matter of
points at the Olympiad, there was little
deep rooted confidence in the ability
of the Americans to carry off premier
honors in the most coveted race on the
program. For years field and track
sports of all sorts had been enjoying
a healthful development in this country,
but the improvement in the class or
long distance runners had been so
gradual that it was hardly considered
likely that any American would bo able
to successfully match strides with the
stars representing the nations that had
for cent ries made an especial effort
to foster long distance running.
In the hope of at least making a
creditable showing in the Marathon,
several Americans went to the murk.
The result Is history—Dorando failing
in sight of the goal, while Hayes sped
to victory. It was not until the eighties
that American trac* athletes pitted
themselves against the English, Myers
and Merrill In 1881 being pioneers in
the movement that had its culmination
in Hayes' achievement.
While one of the oldest events on the
athletic card, the Marathon race was
almost forgotten until the revival of
the ancient games In an International
athletic contest in Athens in 1896. These
contests were held in the restored sta
dium that had existed before 330 B. C,
toward whose first erection patriotic
citizens had contributed everything
from the gold of one to the thousand
yoke of oxen that another gave, and
whose seats were covered with marble
si bs by Herodius as a gift to the Pan
athenaic festival. Time and war and
forgetfulness had burled the stadium,
but in 1863 Tit was partially excavated,
and before these international contests
it had been restored to Its original de
sign, the underground chambers for the
athletes being the same as when first
used 2000 years before.
There the first athletic Marathon
race was run in memory of that his
toric day 2276 years before, when one
Phllippides, an Athenian soldier, ran
from the plains of Marathon to the
palace In Athens to tell the kins of
the victory of Miltiades and his Atheni
an and Platean freemen over the mer
cenaries of Dar'.us. The runner dropped
dead at the feet of his ruler, so history
and tradition assert. The city accord
ed him every civil and military honor,
his body lying in state In the capitol
for three days. Among the most an
cient pieces of sculpture is that of the
dying Marathon runner.
Marathon lies on the northeast const
of Attica. There the worshp of Apollo
had its first homo, and the district
'boasts that Hercules was first wor
shiped there. On the battlefield is a
mound, or soroa. where the 192 Athenian
dead were hurled nfter the battle. It
was from this historic place that the
course of a novel race was laid out in
1896. a course that followed as near
as history coul*. show the path taken
by Phlllppides, and measuring twenty
six miles and 385 yards. On the day
of the new Marathon the king of the
Greeks was to receive the runner as
did his predecessor, though this time
SO 000 people waited, knowing, 'for the
coming of many runners. Tl.~ fact that
the runner was Splros Louces, son of a
peasant of Attica, brought forth the
greatest applause of the whole contest,
and enthusiastic chroniclers aver that
the great shout rolled" off against Mount
Pentelllcus on the one side and Mount
Hymettus on another as did the joy
ous acclamations of tha people of
twenty-two centuries before.
Marathon races had little hold on
popularity after this until the London
event last year, though it was hoped
at the time of the Buffalo exposition
that the stadium erected there might
remain permanently and the Marathon
run then under such climatic difficul
ties would become a big event In future
athletics. Hayes 1 winning acted as an
inspiration to the athletes of America,
and clubmen, schoolboys and college
students Immediately took to distance
running, which, even now, is complete
ly overehadowlng in publl favor track
contests at shorter distances.
In this country the colleges exercise
such a decided influence over athletics
that the clubmen copy the methods and
ingly saying they were only necessary
evils, an intelligent looking girl sud
denly stopped, and putting out her
hand majestically toward the man, said.
impressively:
"I have never had much faith in an
incubator, but now I am a firm believer
in them; a man never could talk like
that that ever had a mother." That
man instantly sneaked away.

ANSWERS ATTACK MADE
AGAINST SPIRITUALISM
LOS ANGELES, May 6.—[Editor
Herald]: If It be permissible to butt
Into another man's argument I beg
leave to differ with the argument
brought against spiritualism by Mr.
Spradlng. For a considerable time ha
"has appeared before the public as a
demolisher of popular Idols. Orthodox
Christianity, Christian Science, Marx
lan Socialism and Spiritualism have
been felled to the ground by his an
archistic fist, and by this time he must
have more scalps on his belt than any
other Liberal club member. No doubt
but what Mr. Sprading is sniffing
around for new game elsewhere. But
some of us won't give;up yet.
His argument against Spiritualism
is that;there is fraud: associated with
it that j the phenomena l of mediums
can be duplicated, V and that certain
scientific men are against it. Well, if
systems followed by the students, anj
the mot successful field and track
teams representing clubs depend large
ly upon former college men for their
real strength.
Johnny Hayes has written many ar
ticles on how to excel in the sport.
pointing out especially that the
important quality in a runner is dog^i il
persistence In training. Many of thn
greatest runners the world has ever
known first took up the sport for exer
cise alone, and it was on these pleasure
runs that they discovered that they
could attain a spe#d grreat enough to
enter races. In nearly every city
are at present clubs thatwere organ
ized to encourage Maraffion running.
Thousands" of men and boys who befor.j
last year never donned a running shoa
|are now undergoing especial courses in
developing wind and limb in the hope
of not only Improving their health but
becoming good athletes.

The usual mode of training is to jog
a couple of miles three times a week
on a pood road until the athlete or
his trainer feels that he Is sufficiently
developed to take longer distances,
when he commences to go ten or fif
teen miles without stopping. So numer
ous are the races at present that thera
is little need of a runner extending
himself to the limit. Few of the b«st
Marathon stars ever go the full dis
tance except in the races, although
they usually make it a point to run
twenty-five miles at least two or three
times before getting into actual com
petition.
In ihe Iden days, when a long dis
tance runner started his training he
usually denied himself every luxury
in order to work off surplus flesh, and,
as he thought, get in the very best con
dition. But all this has been changed
by the modern school of training, and
the almost universal rule at present is
to allow a man almost anything In
I the way of oating that does not disa
gree with him. It is Tie opinion
of most of the foremost trainers that
a man in training should abstain en
tirely from alcoholic liquors and to
bacco.

Perhaps the oldest of the annual
Marathons in this country Is the one
that has been conducted for the past
eleven years under the auspices of the
Boston Athletic association. It Is con
ceded the title of "American Marathon"
and is viewed each year by thousands
who line the course from beginlng to
end. The craze has also extended to
the navy, where several races have
been run aroand the decks of Uncle
Sam's men-of-war.
Since the London meet several of the
competitors in that race have met in
match contests, and ihe crowds that
have attended these events show beyond
a doubt that interest in the sport is in
no manner restricted to those who are
able to actually participate. Of these
post-Marathons the one that attract
ed the widest interest was the $10,000
Derby which was held in the polo
grounds, New York, last month, which
attracted about 30,000 spectators. In
this the first prize went to Henri St.
Yves, a Frenchman, who was supposed
to be completely outclassed by the for
midable field that included such men
as Hayes of America, Dorando the
Italian and Longboat the Indian. From
the outset St. Yves set a terrific pace
and literally ran his opponents off their
feet, winning by a liberal margin.
From a financial point of view this
race was one of the most successful
field and track affairs ever held in this
country.
One of the peculiar features of the
Marathon running is that the cleverest
men In the sport do not seem to suffer
from overparticlpatlon, a tendency that
must be closely guarded against In
other athletic activities. Dorando has
been in this country since early last
fall, and In that time he has on differ
ent occasions competed against the
best available talent in cities In all sec
tions. Despite the strain he has given
little indication of going "stale," but
on the other hand seeing to improve in
each successive performance. Hayes,
too, has given many exhibitions, and
has run several match races with first
class men, including Longboat the In
dian, who was one of the most promi
nent participants in the stadium tour
ney.
While Hayes has accumulated consid
erable money as the result of his vic
tory in London, it is said on good au
thority that Dorando has made more
than $20,000 since he reached these
shores several months ago—quits a
harvest for a. former pastr" taker in
a small town in the northern part of
Italy.
T.jre is a diversity of opinion among
medical authorities as to the probable
effect of running Marathon races. The
unanimity of opinion is that the sport
among undeveloped schoolboys or other
youngsters should be controlled so as
not to allow the untrained to run in
such a way as to make it too strenu
ous and result in permanent injury.
For centuries walking and running in
the open air have been considered
healthful, but when the distance has
become too long and the strain too
severe it has proved dangerous, as has
been shown by heart failure and even
death among tho runners. Among
trainers and even physicians who have
had opportunities to observe the con
dition of young boys the feeling is that
long races of distance exceeding a
mile should be avoided.
Rut for the thoroughly conditioned
athlete Marathons are not considered
harmful, and the present popularity of
the sport not only promises to become
permanent but should result In the de-^
velopment of long distance runners who
will be able to outclass the runners of
other countries. Among trainers and
other close followers of amateur and
even professional running there is a
feeling that the Marathon has come to
stay.</text>

	<text>JOHNNY HAYES, tha Marathon winner, arrived In
Newark yesterday. The story of how this sapling
of American youth outgamed, outlasted and outran
the pick of athletes of the civilized world In that memo
rable race from the royal gates of Windsor Castle to
tha stadium at ShoppardB Bush, a distance of 20 miles,
885 yards, at tho Olympic games In England last July;
how he carried the Stars and Stripes to victory, beating
out Dorando, the great Italian runner, at the very
threshold of the finish mark, and how Queen Alexandra
herself oestowed upon him the Marathon trophy, has
been blazed before tho public many a time, but, coming
from hls own lips, the following narrative does not coma
amiss.
One would believe that a followor of athletics who
has not heard of Hayes and hls victory must be a resi
dent of Um South Bole, but Johnny, while chatting away at THE STAR office
yesterday, rattled oft a yarn of meeting a chap at Providence last week who
didnt know whether the Marathon was a foot-race or one of these new
fangled aeroplanes. "I wonder If that fellow knows that the Civil War Is
over, and that John L. Sullivan has boon beaten for the heavyweight cham
pionship!” Jokingly remarked Hayes. "If it had happened In Philadelphia
there hilght have been an excuse for It.**
As a mater of fact, Johnny Hayes, since hls victory in England, has be
come almost as prominent as tho President of the United States. Big Bill
Taft, the presidential candidate of tho Republican party, received a great re
ception yesterday at Blaneys Theatre, but when the Marathon winner was
carried upon the stage at Proctors In a scene which represented the finish of
tha race, the applause must have been heard at Union Hill.
And right well ho deserved it. Think of a boy, weighing less than 130
pounds, running more than 2
htU and down, and then to beat out fifty-nine other competitors, the best that
nations could offer. What a strain, what nerve, what a triumph! The faded
shield of red, white and blue In the running shirt worn by the American,
which Is on exhibition In THE STAR window, Is mute testimony of the
gruelling ordeal through which the game little runner had passed.
Hayess Barly Achievements.
Title peer of athletes, a marvel for a youth of hls Inches, was born In
New York 22 years ago. He was not a boy of great physical power, and
didnt even train consistently, according to hls own story, for hls early
raoea But he was fond of athletics, and even In hls boyhood days could
heal "every kid In tho block” at the running game.
Hayes won hls novice race In 1904, when he finished first In the Pastime
id^ 0.1 cross-country run at a distance of six miles.
After he had won that race, P. J. Murray, a familiar figure in tho ath
letic world, slapped the youngster on the back and told him that he would
be great runnor some day.
T took It for so much *hot air* at the time,” said Hayes, "but I deter
knlaod to stick to the game, If only for the sport of It.”
On Thanksgiving Day, 1904, the boy who was later destined to win the
neatest Marathon race in modern history competed In the junior national
icroee-country championship race. He finished third In a field of 88. A year
jjader he finished fourth In the Metropolitan junior championship race.
In 1909 Hayes ran fifth In the Boston Marathon, in which a hundred ath
gcompeted. Last year the little Now Yorker, having Jujst turned hls 21st
carried off third honors In another Marathon at Boston. That was the
Tom Longboat, tho Indian runner, beat tho record for the course by five
tea Hayes trained with the idea of running close to the record, and
|finished only 48 seconds behind, but no runner could keep astride with the
iXndian that day.
i At that, Hayes was delayed two m Inutes by a freight train which crept
across tho course. Longboat had pas sed tho crossing before the freight had
blocked the wan

	<text>CRACK RUNNERS TO SETTLE
WORLD’S MARATHON TITLE,
New York, April IS.—Tlio world’s
Marathon championship will be decided
on the Polo grounds Saturday after
noon, May X, when the best men now
running will compete over the regular
Marathon distance of 26 miles 385 yards.
For some time the Marathon contests
have been confined to a few selected
runners, but the real claimants of the
title have not been seen in competi
tion. Of the men who have appeared
before the American public Henri St.
Yves, the speedy little Frenchman, is
the only one with an unbeaten record
on this side of the water, and the Polo
grounds race will definitely establish a
champion'.
The introduction of new blood will
serve to stimulate the public interest in
long distance running, while the addi
tion of several of the better known
men on this side will bring about the
long-sought opportunity of determining
who is the best Marathon runner in
the world.
So as to make the race a real cham
pionship affair invitations have been
sent out to Henri St. Yves, Dorando
Pietri, John J. Hayes, John Svanborg,
Edouard Cibot, Louis Orphee, Jerry
Simpson, Tom Longboat and Pat
White. This will bring together an ag
gregation of long distance talent never
before entered in an event.</text>

	<text>A SPRINTING START.
CHAMPION HAYES
IN EXHIBITION RUN
BEFORE MARATHON
Eleventh Hour Objection of A. A. 1). Bars
Him from the STAR’S Endurance Test.
Crowd Sees Runner on Broad
Street Just Before Noon.
JOHN J. HAYES, winner of Ihe Marathon race at the Olympic games In
London, gave an exhibition sprint In Broad street this morning Just
a few minutes before the great Marathon race of TIIE EVENING STAR.
This sudden and unexpected change In the advertised program was made
necessary by the eleventh-hour objeo tlon of the Amateur Athletic Union, un
der whose auspices the race Is being run, to having Hayes give an exhi
bition run at any time during the big race
Hayes had agreed to run with the 166 entrants a few miles at the start
of the Marathon, after he had fired the starting gun. He was also to Join
the racers near the finish and come In with them.
The A. A. U. wrote a letter late last
night to THE EVENING STAR for
bidding the running of Hayes during
the Marathon. This letter was not
received until this morning, and not
until then was the race management
aware of the objection to Hayes.
But the Marathon race must comply
strictly to the A. A. U. rules, otherwise
every one of the 166 men entered In It
would be disqualified.
Johnny Hayes left THE EVENING
STAR office shortly before 1 m today.
He was taken In an automobile to
Clinton avenue and Broad street. From
there he made an exh ibition sprint, In
his championship Marathon form, to
THE EVENING ST—', office. Broad
and Market streets.
A few minutes after Hayes finished
this exhibition sprint THE EVENING

Hayee fired the starting gun.
The letter making It Impossible for
Hayes to give his exhibition sprints
while the Marathon Is one, which made
It necessary for him to run before the
regular race, follows:
Marathon Editor,
Newark EVENING STAR.
794 Broad street, Newark, N. J.
Dear Sir—I have just seen a circular
advertising the Newark EVENING
STAR Marathon race, and I notice that
on same It states that Johnny Hayes,
winner of the Olympic Marathon race
In London, will act as starter and will
run exhibition relays at the start and
finish of the race.
Mr. Hayes can act as starter, but the
A. A. U. rules will not permit him to
run relays at the start or during the
race. If you wish him to give an exhi
bition after the race Is over he can do
so, as the race, as far as we are con
cerned, would be closed.
Kindly give this matter your prompt
attention so that there will be no mis
understanding. Yours truly,
II. OBERTUBBESINO.
Chairman Registration Committee.
James E. Sullivan, president of the
Amateur Athletic Union, arrived In
Newark early today to act as referee
of the contest. He declared that It
should prove to be the greatest race
ever run In this country.</text>

NEW YORK, May 16—For all
the shouting there has been about
the decadence of American long
distance running talent it remains
a fact that Uncle Sam's entries
have done as well, if not better
than those of any other nation in
the classic Olympic Marathon.
Finland’s two triumphs since
the war, by Kolehmainen in 1920
at Antwerp and Stenroos, the
cabinet maker, in 1924 at PariR,
are fresher in mind but over the
long stretch of Olympic rivalrv j
America has given a good account
of herself and promises to do so
again this summer at Amsterdam,
with Joie Ray and Clarence De
Mar leading the pack.
Finland and America are the
only nations to produce more
than one Marathon king. The
Yankee triumphs of Hicks at St.
Louis in 1904 and 19-year-old
Johnny Hayes at London in 1908
match the sterling victories of
the Finns in the last two Olym
piads.
On three other occasions in the
games of 1906, 1912 and 1924 the
United States finished no worse
than third. Three of the first
four in 1908 were Yankees. At
Stockholm four years later the
South Africans, McArthur and
Gitsham, finished onedwo hut
Gaston Strobino came in third
for America and ten of the first
18 to finish wore the rod, white
and bine shield on their jerseys.
DeMar was twelfth.

approached before or since by
any other country. Finland did
not have a single finisher in 1912
but landed four of the first ten
places in 1920.
This year there seems at least,
an even chance that the most
highly prized Olympic victory will
go to an American marathoner,
with the prospects now fuvorin t;
either DcMar, 40 years old and a
veteran of two previous Olympics
or Ray, the former mile king.

their performances in the first
official Olympic tryout, are the

seems to ripen and improve with
age. The wiry little Melrose run

keen racing judgment and experi-j
ence in his favor. But his ambi-i
tlon to crown a brilliant career
with Olympic victory this time,
after finishing third in 1024, is
no greater than that of Ray.
Joie, too, has been denied the
satisfaction of Olympic victory in
two previous trips abroad. Where i
he failed as a middle distance j
runner ho is confident of succes:1 I
over th long grind. Ray’s won
derful sttlde, natural grit and con
fidence are In his favor.
The history of the Olympic!
Marathon, rich ns it is in color, I
could have 31 mire dramatic epi-1
sode than a triumph for the old
Kankakee Flier.
Tw no years ago .Toltnny Hayes
made Km elf a national idol by,
his Marathon victory, even!
though it was gained because of j
[he collapse of the Italian, Doran-j
do, who had led Johnny into the:
stadium by a substantial margin!
and who would have won had liis|
stamina been enough to carry 1
him over the remaining few him-1
ilred yards.
The tragedy in that race over
Dorando’s downfall had a comic!
relief in the protest of Hefferon,!
the South African, who finished j
second, that Hayes also was help
ed across the finish. Hefferon
was not inside the stadium when
Hayes finished and had no basis
for such a protest unless he fig
ured it was one way of joining
the general argument that the
Finish aroused.
Hefferon’s friends, in extenua
tion of his failure to win, explain
3d later that the distance wa3
too short for him and that he
was not at his best under about
10 miles.
No other Olympic event is so
universil in interest or repre
sentation as the Marathon. Twen
ty nations entered runners in the
1912 race. Thirty were repre
sented in 1924 when Finland.
